About seven million were residents of the UK. This cyber vulnerability is related to the data breach of the Starwood hotels group in 2014. Marriott bought Starwood in 2016, yet the data breach was only identified in 2018, when Marriott notified the ICO about it. During the investigation, the ICO found that Marriott had employed inadequate security check-ups on its systems after acquiring Starwood. Recently, the ICO decided to fine Marriott with £18.4 million (about EUR 20.4 million). When calculating this fine, the ICO took into consideration the company’s absence of prior violations of GDPR regulations, as well as the company’s full cooperation during the investigation, and personal initiative to notify the affected individuals regarding the data breach."

This fine was related to an incident notified in September 2018 by British Airways, involving the user traffic on the official website of the British Airways being diverted to a fraudulent website. This fraudulent website would harvest the customer details of all clients taken there. The personal data of more than 500,000 customers was harvested during the incident. During the ICO’s investigation, it was found that British Airways was mainly to blame for much of the compromised information, due to inadequate security measures, such as log-in, payment card, and travel booking details. The ICO eventually decided to lower the fine to £20 million (about EUR 22,046,000), taking into consideration the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airline industry."

Still, these attempts were ineffective, and a penalty was issued. The 585 judges had suffered no damage because of this, so the penalty was adjusted by the president of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection."

The attackers blackmailed the operator into paying money for the attacks to stop. As part of the &#8220;deal&#8221;, the attackers offered the operator to create and implement a better firewall protection system that would prevent any future attacks from other parties. The operator agreed to this &#8220;deal&#8221;. The game operator then implemented the new code which indeed proved to be better than the old one used but &#8211; let&#8217;s be honest, unsurprisingly &#8211; also included a backdoor that allowed the attacker to steal all the data that was on the server which included player details and personal information. The attacker uploaded this information on their website after that. "

The culpability of the company was reasonably low to justify this decrease in the fine’s value, due to the fact that the company’s procedure of identifying customers through the hotline by asking only the name and date of birth wasn’t objected by any customer, so the company wasn’t aware of the problem this procedure posed.

The Irish DPA mentioned that this fine only applies to Facebook, and not Instagram or WhatsApp, which Meta also owns. Meta has 5-6 months to comply with this decision but the official statements claimed that they would appeal the fine and that there would be no service disruption to European users. Meta could also avoid the massive fine if the European Union and American officials close the new data-sharing pact (Data Privacy Framework) that harmonizes the GDPR legislation with US data collection. If Meta is to comply with the Irish DPA’s ruling, Facebook will have to delete vast amounts of user data or move it back in a legal space. Meta has become an easy target for GDPR regulations after several multi-million-dollar fines for data leaks and insufficient user consent."

Back in May 2020, the Polish DPA was notified by a third party that a data breach occurred at Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń i Reasekuracji WARTA S.A, regarding an insurance agent posing as a processing agent at the company. The insurance agent sent an insurance policy to an unauthorized third party via e-mail. The document contained personal data regarding the subject of the insurance policy, including first names, surnames, residential addresses, and other information. Then, the supervisory authority demanded that the company clarify whether it performed any risk analyses on the data security of natural persons, in connection to the electronic correspondence sent to an unauthorized third party, as this would make it evident that a data breach had occurred. If a data breach does occur, the company responsible is obligated to notify both the DPA and the affected parties. Despite being sent a letter by the supervisory authority asking for explanations on the data breach, the responsible party did nothing to report the data breach to the DPA or inform the affected data subjects about the data breach. Finally, the DPA initiated administrative proceedings, which eventually prompted the company to report the data breach and notify the two affected individuals about the incident."

The 11 companies misused their right to send postal data messages without being charged until the endo of the Covid-19 pandemic, a possibility brought by a decision of the Czech Republic at the end of October. The DPA considered that the companies had breached Art. 6 (1) GDPR by having no legal basis to send the marketing offers. Moreover, the companies engaged in a breach of Art. 14 GDPR by failing to inform the data subjects about the manner in which their personal data would be used."

The video cameras covered recreation areas, warehouses, workplaces, and even sales areas. The electronics company noted that the video surveillance system had been put in place to prevent any criminal activity and to strictly follow the movement of goods in the warehouses. However, the GDPR states that, to prevent theft, milder alternatives need to be considered first, before moving on to video surveillance. Video surveillance should only be used if there are any reasonable suspicions of theft for specific individuals. However, notebooksbilliger.de had no such suspicions, and utilized the video surveillance indefinitely for two years, without limiting its scope to specific individuals. Some video recordings were even retained for 60 days, which is well over the required time period in such cases. Lastly, many customers of notebooksbilliger.de were affected by the video surveillance, as some cameras covered the seating areas, as well."

However, the data subjects were not provided with an option to refuse to consent to this. If they disagreed with this action from the bank, they were supposed to send a letter of disagreement to each of the companies in the CaixaBank Group. Clearly, this is an absurd predicament, as the AEPD concluded that the bank did not respect its information obligations according to Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR. The information provided to the customers in the privacy policy was not accurate and consistent, it had vague and imprecise terminology, and failed to offer a clear picture of the nature of the data processing as well as what type of information would be processed. Information on the data subject’s rights and the contact information of the data controller were not offered consistently and accurately. Moreover, the DPA also argues that the customers’ consent was not taken effectively, and that the data controller had processed the customers’ data partly illegally, beyond the required scope. Moreover, various deficiencies in the bank’s systems allowed it to obtain consent from customers who had not expressly offered their consent. The data processing was done without a legal basis, thus breaching Art. 6 GDPR."

While the fine is unknown as of now, the DPA listed out the aggravating factors it would take into consideration when applying the fine – (i) the data processor failed to fulfill its obligations to inform the data controller of the breach as per Art. 33 (2) GDPR, (ii) the area of expertise of the company is technical protection, including video surveillance. The DPA also notes that the company in question is a leading company in this domain in Croatia, and as such should hold relevant opinions, advice, and also propose solutions regarding the use of video surveillance systems, setting an example through its conduct."

            "summary": "The company failed to take the adequate organizational and technical measures needed to safeguard the data of citizens who had obtained permits to access specific restricted traffic areas. The data controller was the data processor for the city of Rome during this time. Part of the data controller’s activity involved the processing of individuals’ data regarding the possession of permits for restricted traffic areas. These permits were verified by scanning a QR code located on badges on the vehicle’s windshield. This would allow the city staff to check in real time whether a vehicle was allowed to be in a particular zone, as well as who was the possessor of that permit. However, the DPA discovered that the QR code was a normal QR code which anyone could scan and access the personal information (which included the name of the user and the vehicle’s license plate number). Lastly, the DPA concluded that the city of Rome was using the services of a provider for hosting and maintaining databases without a proper agreement as per Art. 28 GDPR."

Through the data controller, small-sized and medium-sized companies could ask for professional advice on technological and digital processes, if they’d previously received a relevant voucher. However, the Italian DPA investigated the data controller and found out that the data of more than 5000 managers who had made themselves available for consultation was freely available on its website. This personal data included names, e-mails, tax numbers, CVs, and even copies of identity cards and health cards in some cases, and all could be downloaded at any time. Moreover, the website made it possible for anyone to download the directorate resolution that had approved this list of managers, which means the data and information of the directors was also publicly visible. The Italian DPA concluded that the directorate resolution was not an adequate nor sufficient legal basis to disclose this online data which resulted in an unlawful data processing."

The data controller in question, a telecommunications company using the services of the IT provider, told the DPA and its users of a potential breach of personal data committed by the IT provider. This was a security breach that led to unauthorized access and the processing of multiple sets of personal data (28,085 data subjects) by hackers. The security breach happened because the IT provider failed to take the adequate security measures that would protect the personal information from being stolen, thus failing to consider the existing risks. The data controller, as a data processor, would have been forced to take adequate technical and security measures in a way that ensured the consistent anonymity of the personal data, including the regular testing, evaluation and the analysis of how effective anti-hacking responses would be, on the off-chance an attack did happen. During its security assessments, the data controller should have taken into consideration specific security risks related to the personal data of the 28,085 data subjects. Because of this failure to implement the adequate security measures, the Croatian DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider. We don’t know the amount of the fine at this moment. However, when implementing the fine, the DPA considered the nature of the IT provider’s business activity, whose role should have been support other companies through informed guidelines, offering solutions regarding the implementation of web applications, and how to design and introduce adequate technical and security measures."

In many cases, one parent received the residence address of the other parent, even though the other parent had address and name protection.

The DPA received four different complaints against the data controller because of unsolicited telephone advertising. The data controller had assumedly done direct marketing with an automated calling system, but without obtaining valid consent from the data subjects who received the marketing calls. More specifically, the data controller had obtained a form of consent for such direct marketing when any customer subscribed to the online magazine on its website. The subscriber was then required to accept the given terms of the subscription and contract, which also included a consent to direct marketing. But this is where the problem occurs. If the customer did not give his consent to the direct marketing, then he could also not subscribe to the magazine. The DPA claimed that the data controller requested and obtained consent in a way that isn’t compliant with the GDPR. Clearly, the data controller had not specifically requested consent for direct marketing, but rather got an apparent consent with a subscription and other contract terms. This form of consent does not constitute a valid form of consent for the purpose of direct marketing. Furthermore, the customers could not exercise their right to object to direct marketing, since the marketing was carried out by an automated system that could not answer specific queries of the customers. Lastly, the magazine publisher had commissioned an advertising call center to carry out this direct marketing, concluding a contract in this sense."

The data controller stated that the video surveillance system was installed for security purposes. The DPA concluded that the data controller had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, but that it would have to take into consideration the interests of the mostly underaged employees, as well.

More specifically, the DPA found that the data controller had failed to adequately inform its employees about how the system worked, and it also didn’t guarantee the accuracy of algorithms’ results used to evaluate drivers. Furthermore, the DPA also concluded that the data controller had violated the principles of memory limitation and data minimization. For instance, the company’s systems processed the drivers&#8217; data to an extent that was thoroughly unnecessary and exceeded the purpose of the processing. In some cases, they stored the data significantly longer than was necessary. Additionally, the controller had failed to take the adequate technical and organizational measures that would ensure the secure data processing. The data controller also did not conduct a data protection impact assessment, despite this being clearly necessary because the company was dealing with a considerable amount of customer data. The Spanish DPA are conducting separate proceedings against the mother company, GlovoApp23."

            "summary": "The Italian DPA (also known as Garante) fined the municipality of Bolzano with EUR 84,000. One of the former employees of the municipality filed a complaint with the DPA against the municipality. More specifically, the former employee complained that the municipality had processed personal data regarding his internet use during working hours. He received, at a later date, a notice of initiation of disciplinary proceedings. The company had accused him of improperly using the company’s resources for private purposes, having accessed Facebook for more than 40 minutes per day, and staying on YouTube for more than 3 hours. During an investigation, the DPA found out that the municipality had been actively monitoring employees’ internet browsing for over a decade, using a certain system of control and filters. They would retain data monthly, and create special reports for their network security purposes. The system would also collect information that was completely irrelevant regarding the employees’ professional activities and, in many cases, concerned the private lives of the individuals in question. The Italian DPA found out that the data controller had violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The data controller should have clearly taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of their Internet network. The Italian DPA pointed out that, despite the company needing to ensure employees don’t use the internet connection for their private use and only focus on their professional goals, this does not condone the total elimination of privacy of the data subjects at the workplace. Additionally, the data controller had failed to adequately inform employees about this collection of Internet history, thus violating its obligations under Article 13 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA investigation identified other violations in the processing of data regarding employees&#8217; requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which had been made using special forms. The form offered by the data controller would be checked and assessed by the head of the organizational unit, and these circumstances led to the unlawful processing of the health data."

These forms contained specific information about any previous or existing infectious diseases like hepatitis, tuberculosis, or HIV. The Italian DPA concluded that this was a violation of the principles of legality. While it was legitimate for the dentist to ask for such information in order to better plan medical treatment, it still wasn’t allowed nor permissible to collect such information and then refuse treatment to the patient."

These data sets included credit terms and residential address information of other customers. The “My Page” section had been used previously for 500 customers, to offer an overview of loans they had taken out with the data controller. Based on its investigations, the DPA discovered that the data controller failed to comply with the GDPR&#8217;s requirements for risk assessments as well as taking the appropriate technical measures regarding the launch of the customer portal. According to the DPA&#8217;s assessment, the security breach would have been preventable if the data controller had previously conducted a risk assessment and review as required by law."

Back in January, the municipality of Rygge was annexed to the municipality of Moss. Therefore, a couple of IT systems from both municipalities were combined in a single, encompassing system. Because of the inadequate security measures, one of the municipality’s health services suffered a data breach in one of its productive systems. This particular system processed personal and health data of ill people who lived in the municipality and used the respective health center. The system was also used for other services related to immunization programs and health checks and follow-ups for pregnant women. Approximately 2000 people were affected by this breach, and because of it, various errors appeared in the vaccine registration. So, this led to an increased risk of data subjects receiving the wrong vaccines. Not only this but their immunization data could have been misfiled in the national immunization registry because of the data breach. Moreover, the health programs for pregnant women also got an error related to the information about the week of pregnant and the motherțs drug use. Finally, health workers in a health service ward could access the patient information without ever needing a special type of access."

They had to prevent threatening situations, document any dangerous incidents, and fine people who traveled without valid tickets on the public transportation in Stockholm. The ticket inspectors had to keep the camera on during their shift, and were able to capture all passengers who passed the inspector. Because a couple hundred thousand people use the public transportation daily, this was a major incident of potential data leakage because of the inspectors’ body cam footage that captured all these people. While the DPA understands how the body-worn surveillance system technology could prevent threatening situations, the pre-recording time should still be reduced to 15 seconds at best. Any longer than that and the recording becomes redundant and goes above the purpose of the body cam footage. The DPA also discovered that the audio recordings weren’t used to identify the individuals with no valid tickets. So, the DPA stated that capturing the audio recordings was a violation of the principles of transparency, data minimization, and legality. The DPA also firmly criticized the data controller for failing to provide adequate information about the camera surveillance, including the fact that both sounds and images were recorded."

The Region of Syddanmark had kept at the time a database for research and clinical purposes for a period of more than 1.5 years.

Through a manipulation of URLs, everyone could technically gain access to PDF documents stored in the database. This allowed all citizens who were registered in the database &#8211; and who also had login information to the database &#8211; to access the personal data of all the individuals registered in the database.

These violations included a clear lack of transparency regarding the algorithms used to manage drivers, both during the assignment of jobs and when they booked work shifts. Deliveroo had been using a centralized system to manage its drivers, but the system also processed the assignment of orders and the booking of work shifts. However, Garante noticed that the data controller failed to properly inform its drivers about how the system they had installed on their smartphones worked, and also failed to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the algorithmic systems they used to evaluate the drivers. Additionally, Garante also found that Deliveroo had underwent a detailed assessment of the drivers&#8217; work performance &#8211; through the continuous geolocation of their device, which was disproportionate to the assignment of the order (e.g., recording the drivers’ position every 12 seconds) &#8211; and through the retainment and storage of a certain amount of personal data the company collected during the execution of the orders, including any communication with customer service. In this sense, the company failed to mention or define the storage period of the personal data they had collected from the drivers. Instead, the data controller had only defined a flat storage period of six years. Moreover, Garante discovered that the data controller had failed to implement the necessary technical and organizational measures that would ensure adequate security of the data processing.

The CNIL also received seven complaints from various data subjects affected by this file.

Additionally, CNIL stated that each person had been assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their credibility, support, and influence for Monsanto on several issues. The DPA believes that the company had critically violated the regulations of the GDPR by failing to inform the data subjects that their personal data was processed and stored in this file. Furthermore, the CNIL claimed that the company had foregone the contractual guarantees which would have regulated the relationships between the company and other subcontractors. Still, creating contact files for lobbying purposes by stakeholders is not illegal. But the data subjects were still within their rights to be informed about their data being in this file, in order to exercise other rights, such as the right to object to the data storage. Moreover, the CNIL discovered that the data collection had been carried out by a data provider that Monsanto had contracted, though in violation of Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation because it failed to include in its contracts with the data processor the provisions stated in the GDPR, more specifically the provisions regarding data security."

            "summary": "The Austrian DPA has fined Rewe affiliate Ö-Bonus Club GmbH with EUR 2,000,000. During the signing up procedure for the jö Bonus Club customer loyalty program, the data controller failed to adequately explain that customers&#8217; data and shopping behavior are directly used to create individual profiles, and that the collected information is also passed on to partner companies. According to the GDPR, the information provided must be easily accessible understood. However, the data controller had designed the registration procedure for the jö Bonus Club in a way that the clarification about the data usage and profiling was only accessible after scrolling down. But the consent was located higher up, so in all cases, the customers would give the consent before reading the clarification. Moreover, the physical flyers also contained a signature bottom on the bottom that not only acted as a confirmation in the enrollment to the club, but also a consent to the data profiling (which wasn’t stated as such). The DPA concluded that the data controller violated its duty as a data controller to provide consent and clarification in an understandable and easily accessible form in clear and simple language. As such, the DPA deemed the consents to be invalid, and the profiling that had been performed based on these consents were unlawful."

The data subject claims that she had been receiving calls from the company ISGF, which acted on behalf of the data controller, claiming a debt received from a third party for an ADSL connection for the residence of the data subject. However, the data subject had never concluded a contract for an ADSL connection. Instead, a third party fraudulently used the name and ID number of the data subject to conclude a contract in her name. The data subject then requested ISGF to cancel the contract and asked the data controller to delete her personal data. However, the data controller had failed to respond to her deletion request. The DPA then imposed a fine of EUR 120,000 which consisted of EUR 70,000 due to a violation of Art. 6 (1) GDPR and EUR 50,000 due to a violation of Art. 17 (1) GDPR.

However, back then, the sales staff had been working for another company and they’d concluded an agency contract with that company. The DPA states that the use of such personal data that these sales representatives knew from previous activities to other companies represented a breach of contract with that company. Moreover, there was no legal basis justifying the data processing for advertising purposes regarding the present data controller."

The data controller had previously implemented a mobile application, allowing teleworkers to clock in and out. However, to use this application on a mobile device, the workers had to provide location data. The data collection took place automatically when the workers clocked in, and it was an in-built feature of the app. Without this feature, the workers couldn’t clock in. Based on the information provided by the data controller, this location data was not used nor exploited in any specific way, but rather it was only processed when the workers clocked in, for technical reasons. However, the simple fact that the app doesn’t allow workers to clock in without collecting their location data doesn’t make it a necessity to collect that data. The company could have devised the app differently. At that point, the Finnish DPA concluded that the company had violated data collection principles as well as the principle of data minimization, since it wasn’t necessary to collect location data."

According to the region, all staff and patients at a lifestyle center could access a building where approximately 100,000 physical patient records were stored. These records included health information and personal identity number details. This data breach took place because both staff and patients had received key cards that allowed them to access all three buildings of the lifestyle center, even though the users may not require to use them. Additionally, passersby could see the covers of some records though a window on the building. These covers showed personal data such as identity numbers and names. Therefore, the DPA concluded that the Midtjylland Region had failed to take adequate security measures to store the personal data. Moreover, the region had further failed to establish enough guidelines for access restrictions when creating the security key cards, and had also failed to conduct the necessary periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the security measures it had taken.

The DPA had previously launched an investigation after an individual had complained to the authority about the newest parking meters installed in the city in 2018. In fact, the company who managed the parking lots and who was contracted by the city, Atac s.p.a., had performed a technical upgrade of the parking meters to provide new services (such as the payment of fines/fees or the purchase/renewal of public transport tickets) and introduce new payment methods that could also take into account the vehicle&#8217;s license plate number. Some of the equipment had been supplied by another company called Flowbird Italia s.r.l. All the parking information was then pooled and managed through a centralized system that could also be accessed through an app by any employees responsible for managing parking fees. The DPA investigation found some irregularities with this process. The city of Rome, as the data controller, had failed to provid information on the processing of the drivers&#8217; data, failed to designate the company Atac as its data processor, and has also failed to provide the necessary instructions to process the data collected. Also, the subcontractor that the city had hired did not receive any formal instructions on how to proceed with the data processing. It was also discovered that the companies had failed to establish a data processing register. Moreover, the retention periods for the collected data had not been specified, and appropriate security measures had not been taken. For instance, the DPA found out that, at the time of the audit, some data leaks going to and from the system installed by Atac had been going through insecure channels. Additionally, officials of the city could have easily checked any license plate en masse and repeatedly to, say, find out a person&#8217;s parking location and habits. When calculating the fine for this unlawful data processing, the DPA took into account and aggravating factor, that of the large amount of personal data processed (from June 2018 to November 2019, the system established by Atac had already finished collecting the data of approximately 8,600,000 stops. This could potentially affect all users of the paid parking service in the city area), as well as the sanctions already received for data protection violations, but also the helpful cooperation offered by the city officials and the companies to remedy some violations detected during the inspection."

The stick was used to store the data of about 400 persons under probation supervision. The lost and unencrypted data carrier has been found yet, so this means that unauthorized persons could still be able to access the personal data it contained. The president had wrongfully assumed that the duty to secure the data wasn’t his but the respective probation officers’ who were using this data stick. However, the DPA found that the president himself should have secured the USB sticks."

The data controller made a comparison between contracts concluded by existing customers and potential customers who had previously submitted inquiries for special contracts. The data controller would reject the application for special contract if it was revealed that the application had previously signed a contract with the data controller then switched to another supplier. This was done to avoid any “bonus shopping”, which companies find unprofitable. However, the data controller failed to inform the customers about the data processing involving these comparisons.

Another customer had been receiving advertising calls on his telephone number, at which point he informed Vodafone during such a call that he did not want to receive further advertising calls.

Yet another data subject filed outa form where he clearly stated that he did not want to receive more marketing calls from Vodafone.

            "summary": "The Norwegian DPA has fined Ferde AS, which is a Norwegian toll company, with EUR 496,000. After receiving a report from NRK, state-owned broadcasting company, the Norwegian DPA started investigating Ferde AS, discovering that the company had been transferring information on passages in various toll rings to a data processor in China. In this context, the DPA started a large-scale investigation into the company, with the purpose of finding out whether the company had implemented measures and routines that could ensure the information security of this information transfer to China. It should be noted that Ferde AS was also responsible for registering passages at toll booths through a chip in the car. If a car had no chip or if the chip wasn’t properly registered, a photo of the car’s license plate would be taken. These images would then be sent to an automatic optical character recognition system that would digitally read the license plate. If the image wasn’t clear enough, it would go through manual processing. Ferde AS had contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS) to do this job. During the investigation, the DPA found out that the subcontractor also had employees in China. Moreover, Ferde AS had violated many obligations under the GDPR for 1-2 years. In on instance, Ferde failed to conduct a risk management assessment before the processing of personal data and the processing of manual images. This risk assessment was necessary to assess any underlying risks associated with the data transfer, and to also determine whether further security measures should be taken. Additionally, the DPA discovered that Ferde did not enter an official processor contract with UBS. Therefore, the transfer of personal data to China occurred without a legal basis. When determining the value of the fine, the DPA also considered the large amount of the affected personal data as an aggravating factor. However, the implicated data subjects received no material or immaterial damage, which had a mitigating effect on this whole affair."

The Danish Cancer Society had previously reported a total of four data breaches according to Art. 33 GDPR to the DPA. Two of these data breaches involved computer thefts and two phishing attacks &#8211; all four were caused by the Danish Cancer Foundation&#8217;s failure to implement organizational and technical measures that would ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to data subjects. A similar personal data breach had already occurred in August 2018, when the Foundation encountered spoofing and phishing hacking attacks. The Danish Cancer Society claimed that it should increase protection via multifactor authentication. However, the society did not implement this. The data of at least 1,448 individuals was compromised, and in several cases, it involved sensitive personal health data, including medical history."

A data subject had complained against the controller with the DPA, saying that she had received a contact request on LinkedIn by one of the La Prima employees. The employee wanted to offer real estate services regarding a specific property owned by the data subject in question. The data controller had apparently obtained the contact data of the data subject as well as information about the ownership of the property from a public register. But the data subject had not consented to this contact request. During the DPA investigation, the data controller argued that it doesn’t need consent in this case because the data subject had a public profile. However, the DPA stated that the exchange of information on a social network should only be carried out within the relevant terms of use. The DPA further claimed that the social media platform is in its right to enable the exchange of contact information to make job offers. However, social media platforms aren’t meant to be used to send messages to other users to sell services. Moreover, it doesn’t matter if the profile was public or not. So, the DPA concluded that the data controller had processed this data unlawfully."

Apparently, the draft addresses the fact that Facebook had included specific details on data processing in its terms of service, following the provisions of Art. 6 (1) b) rather than Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR. Some critics call this a loophole that Facebook intelligently uses to bypass the strict GDPR requirements of consent, those of Art. 6 (1) a). On the other hand, the DPC clearly states that the GDPR doesn’t establish any hierarchy of specific legal bases that a company can use to process personal data. However, the DPC further noted that Facebook did not provide any clear information regarding the legal basis it used for the data processing, further emphasizing that Facebook provides discontinuous information. The company also sends users to various texts and documents of the terms of services and data policy. The DPC thus concludes on its draft that Facebook had violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, art. 12 (1) GDPR, and Art. 13 (1) c).

During the DPA’s investigation, the administration of the institution argued that they had installed the video surveillance system to combat theft and provide adequate safety to the residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic. However, the DPA stated that the institute had violated the principles of transparency, lawfulness, and data minimization. Even though the institution claimed that the quality of the footage showing the passage of the residents to the shower room was not clear enough and also of a short duration, the DPA states it was still unlawful. The DPA also claims that the institute could have ensured the safety of its residents in other, less invasive ways that would not restrict the freedoms of the data subjects, referring to a temporary switch-off of the cameras when filming the corridor to the shower rooms, or ensuring the security of these locations through other measures aside from video surveillance. Moreover, the DPA states that the institute failed in properly informing its residents about the video surveillance. They only provided information about the surveillance system to their residents after the DPA investigation had formally begun. Ironically, the information they offered wasn’t suitable for blind or visually impaired people. Instead, the institute should have provided its residents with pre-recorded audio-messages that the residents could listen to."

            "summary": "The Italian DPA (also known as Garante) has fined Bocconi University with EUR 200,000 after a student had filed a complaint with the DPA regarding alleged GDPR violations related to the use of a surveillance system during written exams. During the emergency situation of the Covid-19 pandemic where students couldn’t take live exams and in person, the university acquired a remote monitoring software called Respondus, from the American company called Respondus Inc. This software would monitor the students’ behavior via video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. Additionally, the exam was also audio-visually recorded, and the students had their photographs taken at the beginning of the exam. When the exam finished, the system would process the video and insert warning signals attached to each video, regarding potential indications of incorrect behavior (foul play). Among others, the system assigned “review priorities” to various videos so the examiner could further analyze whether there was any foul play in the video. During an investigation, the DPA discovered that the students hadn’t been informed about the processing of their personal data via Respondus. For instance, the students hadn’t been informed that they would be audio-visually recorded, and that these images would then be processed. Moreover, the students weren’t provided with any information regarding the retention period of this data. They also weren’t given enough information about whether or not their data would be transferred to the United States. Instead, they were only told that their data would be processed both inside and outside the European Union. Moreover, the DPA also found that even the information provided to the students had been chaotic and disorganized, placed in multiple documents in a fragmented form. This is a clear violation of the principles of fairness, transparency, and lawfulness, according to the DPA. The DPA also found that the university had processed this personal data without a proper legal basis. They needed to obtain the consent of the students regarding this personal data, before they participated in the exams. Alternatively, the university proposed in-person exams but the pandemic meant that this option presented certain health risks. The students also thought that refusing to take the online exams would clearly impact their grades. So, the DPA concluded that the students had not voluntarily given their consent. Moreover, the DPA also discovered that the university had retained the data for 12 months, despite this not being necessary for the purpose of making sure that the exams were valid. Finally, the DPA also discovered several violations regarding the transfer of data to Respondus. Namely, the processing agreement between Respondus and the university relied on the data protection agreement between the USA and the EU, the Privacy Shield agreement, which had previously been invalidated by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Thus, the DPA concluded that the university unlawfully transferred the personal data of the students to a third country, despite this not being compliant with the conditions stipulated in Chapter V of the GDPR."

            "summary": "The Italian DPA (also known as Garante) fined Sky Italia S.r.l. with EUR 3,296,326 for illegal telemarketing. The DPA received numerous complaints from people claiming that they’d received unsolicited telemarketing calls and SMS messages from Sky Italia directly and via various call centers of other companies. So, the DPA started investigating the phenomenon. They found out that Sky Italia had made the calls without properly informing the users how they got their hands on the data subject’s personal data. If Sky Italia had done this, the data subjects could have opposed to the data processing by contacting the company who had their data and objecting to the data processing. If the data subjects gave their consent, only then would Sky Italia be allowed to send them commercial offers. Instead, the company used the personal data obtained from various companies for these promotional purposes. However, despite the fact that the data subjects had given their consent to the disclosure of their data to said third party companies, Sky Italia had no right to acquire these lists of personal information and use them for its own promotional purposes. Additionally, Sky Italia also failed to check the list of individuals who had objected to the data processing regarding the advertising messages. Instead, the company proceeded with the marketing calls without taking this into account. Several data subjects who had objected to the data processing ended up receiving advertising calls. Moreover, the DPA discovered that Sky Italia did not appoint its data suppliers as data processors. When calculating the fine, the DPA considered the fact that Sky Italia’s violations implicated a “systemic” conduct that was integral to the company’s other operations, as well as the fact that the company should have made better decisions considering its experience and competence. Given its long-term presence in the market and constant contact with the authorities, Sky Italia should have known better."

The documents contained various data such as health status, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, ethnic origin, political opinions, union memberships, and banking data of the municipality’s employees and residents. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the municipality had various security deficiencies regarding the personal data and other internal security controls. For instance, the municipality did not use two-factor authentication during the log-in procedure into the system, and also lacked proper backup systems."

Additionally, the DPA discovered that the data controller had processed various amounts of personal data from three customers after they had clearly exercised the rights to delete their data and revoke their consent to the data processing. This data processing had been carried out without a legal basis. The DPA fined the company with EUR 5,000 for breaching Art. 32 (1) b), (2) GDPR. As for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR, the DPA only issued a warning."

Back in May 2020, the CNIL received a complaint from a trade union alleging that promotion decision files included the number of strike days exercised by staff. The CNIL then investigated several RATP bus centers. This way, the CNIL confirmed that this was true in three of the RATP bus centers. The French DPA further confirmed that files referring to performance evaluations and prospects should only even contain data that was necessary for evaluating employees during work hours. More specifically, it would have been sufficient that these files indicated the total number of days of absence without detailing and distinguishing between days of absence and days where the workers exercised their right to strike. The CNIL discovered that the data related to the number of days the staff members were on strike haven’t been used for the right purpose, so the RATP had violated the principle of data minimization as per Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA also found that the RATP has excessively retained some of the employees’ data. More specifically, the RAPT had retained files regarding the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission had taken place. The data retention term was 18 months after the commissions were held, so the RATP also violated this principle. The CNIL discovered that the RATP hadn’t differentiated between staff authorization levels properly either, allowing more staff members than necessary to retain certain data. In conclusion, the CNIL considered that the RATP failed to implement the appropriate organizational and technical measures to ensure a proper level of protection appropriate for the risk at hand."

            "summary": "The Dutch DPA has fined the airline Transavia with EUR 400,000. In 2019, the airline had suffered a data breach in which a hacker gained access to the company’s systems via two accounts held by the IT department of the company. This may have potentially allowed the hacker to gain access the personal data such as dates of birth, names, email addresses, genders, phone numbers, flight information, and booking numbers of more than 25 million passengers. The DPA discovered that the hacker downloaded the personal information of 83,000 people. In 367 cases, this personal data also included medical information of people who had requested wheelchair transportation or additional services due to being deaf or blind. The DPA further noted that the lack of security measures allowed the hacker to access the company’s systems. Apparently, accessing the airline systems could be done simply by entering the required password. That’s because the systems did not have any multi-factor authentication measures in place. Moreover, the accounts themselves didn’t only have access to the necessary systems but also to other systems as well, which allowed the hacker to gain access to multiple systems of Transavia. The DPA concluded that the airline company Transavia had breached its duty to implement proper technical and organizational measures that would ensure a level of security appropriate to the perceived risk of the data subjects."

Apparently, an unauthorized third party had gained access to the medical database of Vastaamo on two occasions (that we know of), one in December 2018 and the other in March 2019. The attacked had stolen data and left a ransom note on the database servers. Because of insufficient data logging, the DPA couldn’t identify the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses that the attacker used. As for the cause of this data breach, it was most likely an unprotected port on the database where the root user account was not protected by a password. The patient database server was left open to the Internet without firewall protection between November 26th, 2017, and March 13th, 2019. In these circumstances, the DPA concluded that the personal data of the patients wasn’t properly protected against unauthorized and unlawful access, processing, destruction, accidental loss, or damage. The data controller also failed to implement the proper measures that would secure the processing of the personal data. During its investigation, the DPA determined that the data controller had known about the data breach of its patient medical data and about the unauthorized access of the attacker ever since March 2019. The Vastaamo psychotherapy center should have reported the security breach to the patients involved and the DPA as soon as it happened. However, the data controller was very late in meeting this obligation. The fine is composed of EUR 145,600 for breaching Art. 33 (1) GDPR, EUR 145,600 for breaching Art. 34 (1) GDPR, and EUR 316,800 for breaching Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR."

The DPA further discovered that this data breach had taken place because of the company’s failure to comply with its obligation to implement the required organizational and technical measures that would ensure adequate security appropriate to the risk of the data subjects. For instance, the company didn’t appoint a person competent enough to oversee the security and risk management. It also didn’t ensure that accesses to database files were logged and evaluated. Moreover, the company hadn’t encrypted the stored databases. A person with enough technical knowledge could gain full access to the data contained in the file after downloading it.

            "summary": "The Norwegian DPA has fined Grindr LLC with EUR 6,300,000. Grindr is a location-based social networking app that was designed for bi, gay, trans, and queer people. Back in 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority had filed a complaint against Grindr to the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the platform had shared information about its users’ GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender to other third parties for marketing, without obtaining the consent of the data subjects. As per GDPR, that personal data should have only been shared with consent from the data subjects. However, the DPA discovered during its investigation that the consent collected by Grindr was invalid. Users had to accept a privacy policy when using the app but the policy didn’t explicitly ask them whether they consented to their data being shared to third parties for marketing purposes. Moreover, information about the disclosure of personal data wasn’t immediately clear or accessible to users. The DPA shows that the type of data disclosed could identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. The users would sometimes use this app anonymously without inputting their full name or uploading a photo of them. As for the sexual orientation of the users, it was made part of a special category of personal data that is subject to a special, high level of protection. The DPA concludes that this infringement was particularly serious and it justifies a high fine as a deterrent. GDPR considers that this type of fine should act as a strong deterrent for business models based on behavior-based marketing, which are widespread in the digital economy today."

However, as of May 2018, data about the dual citizenship of about 1,4 million people was still registered in the systems of the customs and tax administration. The DPA determined that this data had been unlawfully processed because of a lack of valid legal basis. Moreover, the DPA claims that the data subjects had been discriminated against because of their nationality."

Back on December 27th, 2019, the Cabinet Office had published a file on GOV.UK that contained the uncensored names and addresses of more than 1,000 individuals who had received New Year’s honors. Among the affected individuals were people ranging from various profession across the United Kingdom, even individuals with high public profiles. After the Cabinet Office learned of this data breach, it removed the web link to the file hosted on the internet. However, the file was still contained within the cache and was accessible online to people who had access to the same exact website address. This personal data was disclosed online for two hours and 21 minutes and had been accessed a total of 3,872 times. This data breach occurred because of an error in the setup of the Cabinet Office’s new IT system, apparently. The United Kingdom ICO discovered that the Cabinet Office didn’t take the appropriate organizational and technical measures that would ensure a proper level of protection appropriate to the risk of the data subjects."

During the analysis, the NGO had processed the data of 55,000 Twitter individuals. 3,300 of these had been classified as political. The information obtained from these accounts was published without taking minimal security precautions (anonymizing the data). The DPA noticed that the publication of this data could expose the data subjects to discrimination or discreditation because of the non-anonymous political profiling. Additionally, these files contained information about the data subjects’ sexual orientations, religious beliefs, and ethnic origins.

Back in 2018, the NGO had published an analysis to help identify the political origins of tweets that were circulating on a heated controversy in France, the “Benalla affair”. During the analysis, the NGO had processed the data of 55,000 Twitter individuals. 3,300 of these had been classified as political. The information obtained from these accounts was published without taking minimal security precautions (anonymizing the data). The DPA noticed that the publication of this data could expose the data subjects to discrimination or discreditation because of the non-anonymous political profiling. Additionally, these files contained information about the data subjects’ sexual orientations, religious beliefs, and ethnic origins. As a result, the DPA concluded that several principles of the GDPR like the transparency to data subjects or the lawfulness of processing and data security, had been violated."

            "summary": "The Belgian DPA has fined IAB Europe with EUR 250,000. The DPA had previously received many complaints against IAB Europe ever since 2019. Regarding this complaint, the DPA questioned the compliance of IAB Europe with the “Transparency &#038; Consent Framework (TCF). The TCF had been developed by IAB to promote compliance with the GDPR through organizations that used the OpenRTB protocol. This protocol is used for “real-time bidding” like the automated online auctions of user profiles regarding the purchase and sale of advertising space on the web. Users would visit websites that contain ad space that technology companies can bid for in real time through automated auction systems. This was done to display personalized advertising to users. Upon visiting a website for the first time, an interface would appear asking users for consent to the collection, sharing, and other types of processing of their personal information. During this process, the TCF employs a specific consent management tool that allows users to reject certain types of data processing. This TCF remembers the users’ preferences via the consent management tool by generating a TC string and sending it to everyone that participates in the OpenRTB system. This TC string allows user profiles to be compiled and sent to advertisers. The advertisers will see the types of data processing that the users have agreed to. The DPA noticed that the IAB had violated several of the GDPR regulations during the investigation. It discovered that these TC strings already contained personal data, which required a legal basis for its processing, which IAB did not have. IAB couldn’t prove that it had any legal basis to process these TC strings, though. For instance, when users were informed about the data processing, the information provided to them was far too generic and vague to properly understand the purpose of the data processing. Moreover, IAB did not maintain any register of its data processing activities and had also failed to appoint a data protection officer. It also did not conduct any data protection impact assessment."

Moreover, the DPA also discovered that Cosmote didn’t explicitly regulate the allocation of roles within the data processing of its subsidiary, the OTE Group.

The data subject also requested a copy of the personal data of the company, including a copy of the video surveillance footage narrowed to a specific time and area. However, the energy company denied this request, justifying by: (i) a lack of a written request by the competent authorities to deliver this footage, (ii) the lack of a justified purpose for the request, and (iii) the claim that offering a copy of this footage would negatively affect the rights and freedoms of the petrol station’s customers and personnel. After the DPA issued its general opinion and claimed that the energy company is under legal obligation to provide the surveillance footage to the data subject, the energy company informed the customer that this wasn’t possible. The energy company claimed that the video surveillance footage archives are being erased after seven days. The DPA concluded that the energy company had violated the fundamental rights of the data subject and issued a fine of HRK 940,000,000.

However, the company also cooperated fully during the investigation which led to some of the damage being mitigated. The company also clarified the facts on its own and made sure that such violations wouldn’t be repeated in the future."

During the investigation, the DPC found out that Meta could not prove that it had taken the necessary organizational and technical measures that would protect the data of EUR users. The fine proceedings were carried out with cross-border data processing, and that’s why a decision was only met through the co-decision procedure under Art. 60 GDPR, involving all the European advisory authorities. Although two other European DPAs objected to the draft decision of the DPC, a consensus was reached in the end. As it stands, the DPC’s decision to fine Meta with EUR 17,000,000 is the collective decision of all the other European DPAs."

During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the National Visa Information System (NVIS) had major security deficiencies. This is a serious matter seeing as though the Foreign Ministry processed around 530,000 visa applications per year over the last 3 years. The personal data processed during those applications was, as it seems, insufficiently protected. This data included sensitive information like name, address, fingerprints, place of residence, country of birth, nationality, and purpose of travel. Because of these inadequate security measures, unauthorized individuals could have accessed the data at any time. The DPA noted that the Foreign Ministry had been aware of this security weakness for quite some time. However, they didn’t do anything to adjust the security system. This is why DPA concludes that the ministry was negligent. It was also found that the Foreign Ministry didn’t adequately inform individuals who applied for visas that their personal data would be shared with third parties. This resulted in a fine of EUR 565,000 being issued to the Dutch Foreign Ministry."

This data included information about the first names, surnames, data on medical examinations and illnesses, social security numbers, and the names of the physicians. During the investigation the CNIL discovered that DEDALUS BIOLOGIE had violated several GDPR regulations. For instance, DEDALUS had violated Art. 29 GDPR by processing more data than was necessary during the processing of two laboratories’ patient data. Moreover, the DPA also discovered that DEDALUS did not implement the necessary organizational and technical measures that would ensure the proper protection of the personal data. This is a clear violation of Art. 32 GDPR by itself. The company did not implement any specific security procedures during the data migration operations. Moreover, the data that was leaked was not stored on an encrypted server either. The DPA also discovered that DEDALUS had not implement authentication for access in the public area of the server. This is the main reason why the data leak took place, in fact. Furthermore, the DPA discovered that none of the contracts established between DEDALUS and its clients complied with the requirements set by the GDPR in Art. 28. The DPA took into consideration the aggravating factors and the seriousness of the violations, as well as the large number of data subjects who had been affected, when imposing the fine."

            "summary": "The Dutch DPA has fined the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration with EUR 3,7 million. This marks the largest fine ever issued by the Dutch DPA after an investigation. During the investigation, the DPA discovered several violations of the GDPR but the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. The data controller had been keeping a list of indications of fraud for several years. This list contained information on more than 270,000 data subjects, including minors. The administration had processed the personal data, which included citizenship, health, and criminal personal data, as part of the list maintenance. The DPA initially discovered that the administration had no valid legal basis to process this personal data. As such, the data gathered had been processed unlawfully. Moreover, the DPA discovered that the information in this list was also incorrect at times, where many individuals had been falsely registered as possible fraudsters. Additionally, the investigation also revealed that the maintenance of this list resulted in the discrimination against several data subjects. The risk of fraud was also determined based on the nationality and appearance of some of the data subjects. For instance, donations to mosques were considered a risk factor for fraud in the administration’s list. Moreover, the DPA discovered that the administration had violated its obligations to implement the necessary organizational and technical measures that would properly protect the collected personal data. As such, the administration had not adequately secured the personal data of the data subjects. The DPA found out that the administration had also violated the principle of storage limitation by keeping this data for longer than was necessary and contrary to the retention period set by the administration itself. The DPA also found out that the processing of this personal data was not necessary for the administration to perform its duties, so the data processing was disproportionate to the claimed purpose. Also, the administration hadn’t clearly defined the posers for the data processing, violating the principle of data limitation as a result. The fine consists of: EUR 1 million for breaching Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR; EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR; EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) d) GDPR; EUR 250,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR; EUR 500,000 for a breach of Art. 32 (1) GDPR EUR 450,000 for a breach of Art. 35 (2) GDPR."

            "summary": "The Spanish DPA (also known as AEPD) has fined Google LLC with EUR 10 million. Two data subjects had filed complaints to the DPA that Google had previously disclosed their personal data to several third parties without their consent. During the lengthy investigation, the DPA discovered that Google had sent the personal data of the data subjects to the Lumen Project. Lumen is a project that’s managed and run by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &#038; Society of the Harvard University. This project began in 2002 for the official purpose of collecting requests related to the removal of content from websites both within and outside of the US. Researchers and other interested parties may then access this data for studies. However, users of the YouTube, Google Drive and other Google-operated platforms could request that the content related to themselves be deleted from these platforms. To this end, Google has provided several complaint and contact forms. However, the data of the people who filed out these forms was automatically transferred to the Lumen Project. The users were not given the chance to object to this data transmission because the process was automatic, and it was a hardwired condition for completing the forms. Consequently, the DPA concluded that Google had no valid legal basis to process the data subjects’ data because of this lack of consent regarding the transfer of data to Lumen. In this context, the DPA also discovered that Google did not sufficiently enable the data subjects to exercise their rights of erasure of their data. When analyzing the fine, the DPA took into consideration several aggravating factors: the data was disclosed and transferred to a third-party country without giving the data subjects a chance to object to the transfer. Moreover, this deprived the data subjects of control over their personal data and its transfer. Additionally, the DPA discovered that this transfer had taken place over a long period of time. Another aggravating factor was that a very large number of individuals were affected by this data transfer, and in some cases, sensitive data had been processed."

Moreover, when the data subjects wanted to exercise their rights under the GDPR, such as the right governed by Art. 15 GDPR, they had to submit more personal data in the form of a photograph that may be matched with the Clearview database. According to the DPA, this is a significant obstacle and deterrent in the exercise of the rights. Additionally, the DPA discovered that the company had violated several of the GDPR principles. For instance, the company had clearly violated the principle of transparency because it failed to adequately inform users about the data processing of their personal data. Clearview also violated the principle of storage limitation because it did not provide a data retention policy, failing to ensure that the data was held for longer than necessary. Finally, Clearview AI did not conduct a privacy impact assessment despite the obvious high risk to the data subjects’ data."

During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the cookie managed used on two websites operated by Roularta failed to comply with the GDPR. To use these cookies, the data controller should have obtained prior consent from its users, except in the cases where the cookies are obligatory for the functionality of the website. The DPA discovered that the consent for the processing of the personal data on Roularta’s websites was not valid because not all conditions were met. Consequently, approximately 60 cookies that were not required were placed on the devices of the users without obtaining their consent first. Roularta also failed to sufficiently inform its users about these cookies. Additionally, the boxes for the consent in placing the third-party cookies were checked in advance even though the users hadn’t checked them (consented to them). Moreover, the DPA discovered that the users could not revoke their consent regarding the cookie placement as easily as they had offered it."

The DPA could also not find any other evidence that justified this extensive video surveillance of the clinic."

The CNIL also discovered that ACCOR had not provided sufficient data to the data subjects about the processing of their personal data regarding the promotional messages, violating Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR. Moreover, ACCOR failed to respond to the data subjects’ requests for access to their personal data in a timely manner, violating Art. 12 and 15 GDPR.

In the ensuing decision, the EDPB requested the DPC to increase the fine.

Additionally, the settings of these accounts had been set to “public” by default, which made their social media content publicly available unless they specifically changed these settings.

Moreover, the portal also transmitted passwords that allowed access to accounts, unencrypted via email. Lastly, the portal stored passwords and secret questions/answers that were used during the process to reset passwords by users in a database that did not use encryption.

These errors may have impacted the right and freedoms of several Danish residents. The DPA then started an investigation at the agency. In spring and summer of 202, several security incidents had occurred in the agency’s systems, leading to the loss of data records. These losses led to several proceedings being initiated against several residents regarding the reduction of their cash benefits. A few residents were also reported for non-compliance with the provisions of the Foreigners act. The DPA also discovered that a lack of organizational and technical measures was at fault for allowing these incidents to occur. For example, the agency had not made sufficient backups of data processed data even though it would have been necessary, considering the potential legal consequences of a loss of data."

From the 122 products in the Health Club catalog of Easylife, 80 of them were classified as “trigger products”. Once the clients would purchase these products, Easylife would create their profiles to target them with additional health-related items. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the company had collected and used the personal data (health data) of about 145,500 data subjects without obtaining their consent. The DPA further noted that the “invisible” data processing of the personal data was a serious violation of the data subjects’ rights because they could not exercise their privacy and data protection rights since they did not know about the data processing. Moreover, the company had made a total of 1,345,732 unsolicited marketing calls to individuals without obtaining their consent for the calls.

To start, the DPA found that Techpump shared the users’ personal data with the companies that belonged to the same group, contradicting its privacy policy. Moreover, the DPA also discovered that Techpump did not specify a retention period for their users’ personal data, keeping it indefinitely until the users requested to withdraw their consent. Techpump was also processing the users’ personal data without obtaining their consent first. Moreover, the DPA discovered that the company did not have the sufficient parental controls to prevent minors under 14 to access its contents. Techpump’s privacy policy was also only available in English rather than Spanish, and the information was unclear at best. Techpump also required that data subjects who wished to exercise their data subject rights would submit their ID card information to verify their identity. The DPA concluded that this was an unacceptable impediment to exercise the data subject’s rights.

During this conversation, the call center concluded a new contract with the data subject without their consent. During the investigation, the Italian DPA discovered that the customer had not received enough information about the processing of her personal data. Moreover, the call center had read the information so quickly that the data subject did not understand most of it, making the transmission of information useless. When calculating the fine, the DPA also took into consideration the aggravating factor of Vodafone having already committed such violations in the past. However, Vodafone immediately terminated the contract, which acts as a mitigating factor."

Moreover, the order processing contract permitted the transfer of all personal data outside the EEA without providing additional security measures besides the SCCS that was approved by the European Commission, as required under the Schrems II Ruling.

During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the personal data contained in the company&#8217;s database had been processed unlawfully and without a valid legal basis. Moreover, the DPA discovered that Clearview AI had restricted the exercise of data subjects&#8217; rights. For instance, it limited the exercise of then data subjects&#8217; rights to twice a year without any justification. Also, data subjects had to submit several requests before even one was answered. Moreover, requests were often not answered at all or were only answered inadequately. Finally, the DPA criticized the cooperation of Clearview AI since the company did not respond to investigation forms at all or only very incompletely."

Interserve had suffered a cyber attack in the past where the attackers had sent a phishing email to the mailbox of the company’s accounting team. The email had been opened by an employee who also downloaded and opened the zip file contained in the attachment.

The stolen data contained the social security numbers, bank account information, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and religion of the data subjects. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the attack was made possible because of inadequate security measures. Interserve employees had not been adequately trained on data privacy and the company processes personal data on unsupported operating systems that did not receive security updates anymore, so new system vulnerabilities weren’t covered. Moreover, Interserve had not conducted the adequate vulnerability scans and the information security team did not sufficiently investigate the attack because the antivirus software installed on the systems reported that the malware had been removed."

            "summary": "The Irish DPA (also known as DPC) has fined WhatsApp Ireland with EUR 5.5 million. The Austrian Organization “None of Your Business” (NOYB) had complained to the DPA on behalf of a data subject. WhatsApp had recently updated its terms of service shortly after the GDPR came into force. In the ToS, WhatsApp informed its users to click “Agree and Continue” to show that they agree with the new terms of service. This was also required for further access to the messaging service. WhatsApp assumed that this consent to the updated Terms of Service constituted a contract between the user and WhatsApp Ireland because the data processing would have been necessary for the provision and the improvements of the messaging service. The data processing was, therefore, lawful according to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant claimed that WhatsApp was trying to process the users’ data by relying on the fact that this consent was lawful. WhatsApp Ireland actually forced users to consent to the processing of their personal data by making access to its services conditional on the users’ consent to the updated Terms of Service. After the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to the other European supervisory authorities implicated. The DPC discovered that WhatsApp had not relied on user content as a legal basis, which further means that “coerced consent” did not apply in this case. Though, this also did not rule out the possibility that WhatsApp had relied on a contractual basis. As a response, the DPC received objections from 6 supervisory authorities. On the other hand, the DPC discovered that Meta had breached its transparency obligations as per the GDPR. Apparently, Meta had not clearly explained to its users for what purpose and on what legal basis would their personal data be processed. Since they couldn’t reach an agreement on these disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure as per Art. 65 GDPR. When making its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by WhatsApp. Apparently, the EPDB had a different perception than the DPC regarding WhatsApp’s entitlement to rely on the contractual legal basis to process the users’ personal data. The EPDB concluded that WhatsApp had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. So, the DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed a fine of EUR 5.5 million, as well as required WhatsApp to bring its data processing into compliance within 6 months."

The Austrian organization “None of Your Business” (NOYB) had complained to the DPA on behalf of two individuals. These complains were related to Meta’s updated Terms of Service. In the update, Meta had changed the legal basis necessary for the processing of personal data regarding the behavioral advertising and other personalized services. Before the change, Meta based the data processing on user content. After the change, Meta relies on the Terms and Conditions to condition its users to accept the processing of personal data for the purpose of personalized advertising. If they want continued access to the Facebook and Instagram services, users are required to accept the updated Terms of Service. Initially, the DPA discovered that Meta had violated its transparency obligations as per the GDPR. However, they also discovered that Meta had not clearly emphasized to users on what legal basis and for what purpose their personal data would be processed. Moreover, the DPA also discovered that Meta could not rely on the Terms and Conditions that both them and their users had contractually agreed to as the legal basis to process the data for behavioral advertising. The DPA claimed that the users would have been pressured into accepting the Terms and Conditions to continue using the services. In this context, the DPA said that the users should be able to explicitly consent or deny the processing of their data for the purpose of this personalized advertising with a simpler yes/no option. Other than imposing the fines, the DPA also required Meta to make its data processing operations comply with the GDPR within 3 months."

The bank then suffered a data breach where unknown third parties compromised the video cameras and posted the images online. They were also able to take control over the cameras to a limited extent.

However, the law didn’t require the collection of an email address back then. Visitors were also required to check a box that stated that they agreed to be contacted by the restaurant. However, the restaurant then used the email addresses of the subjects to send promotional newsletters. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the processing of the email addresses for advertising purposes was unlawful because of the fact that the requirements for giving reliable consent were not met. It was unclear to the data subjects that the restaurant would use the email addresses for advertising purposes. The restaurant operator also did not inform the data subjects about their right of withdrawal of consent."

This is the highest fine ever issued by AZOP as well as the first case where the data controller was publicly named. AZOP had received an anonymous complaint back in December 2022 claiming that a large number of the debtors’ personal data was processed by the collection agency without proper authorization. There was a USB stick attached to the complaint that contained personal data (name, date of birth and personal identification number) of 77,317 debtors. During the investigation, AZOP discovered that the data controller did not offer enough information about the processing of the personal data on its privacy policy. Furthermore, it did not provide information about the legal basis concerning the refund of overpaid funds. The breach affected around 132,652 individuals. Moreover, AZOP also found that the data controller had not entered into a data processing agreement with a data processor that monitored simple consumer bankruptcies. This put the data of around 88,896 individuals at risk. This breach persisted for over 2 years. In the end, AZOP discovered that the data controller had not implemented the required organizational and technical measures that would protect the personal data. There were deficiencies in the security system which allowed the insecure processing of personal data on a very large scale, and this resulted in the unauthorized filtering of the data. AZOP also noticed that the breach had been ongoing ever since 2019 and was not addressed. AZOP also took into consideration various aggravating factors such as: the controller’s failure to reasonably cooperate with the DPA during the investigation. Moreover, the data controller had not even informed AZOP of additional measures it had taken to prevent any future risks of identified violations, and it had also not made its privacy policy compliant with the GDPR."

For instance, the processing systems didn’t have any access restrictions in place. When calculating the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that the company is one of the leading telecommunications companies in Croatia. Due to the high volume of data processed on its premises, the risk of an attach was that much higher, so the company should have implemented the necessary security protection. As such, the company should have been more careful to ensure that the proper security measures were taken."

Moreover, these results had been cross-checked with a credit agency. The goal was to find those customers with a greater willingness to use digital media and to focus on them intensively through electronic communication channels for promotional purposes. Most of the customers were given a notice beforehand. However, the DPA concluded that this did not replace the required consent. When determining the fine, the DPA took into account the fact that the bank did not use the results of these evaluations for anything else. Moreover, the bank cooperated with the DPA during the investigation."

The hospital had previously reported two data breaches to the DPA as per Art. 33 GDPR. In the first case, the neurology department of the hospital had distributed a newsletter in an open distribution list. This resulted in the email addresses of the recipients being visible to all other recipients. Out of the 499 email addresses affected, 321 were related to patients and 46 to family members or caregivers of the patients. This also allowed the individuals to be identified by name. In the second case, the surgical department had sent a newsletter in an open distribution list, so the same problem appeared. Out of the 90 email addresses affected, 75 were related to patients and/or family members or caregivers of the patients, so the recipients could be identified by name. The DPA concluded that this was a violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality. This principle requires that the personal data is processed in a way that ensures the necessary security against unauthorized access. This includes protection against unlawful processing and accidental loss/ destruction or damage, through appropriate organizational and technical measures. Regarding the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating fact that the hospital had introduced several measures to prevent these events specifically, but also the fact that the hospital was highly cooperative with the DPA during the investigation."

            "summary": "The UK DPA (also known as ICO) has fined the Tavistock &#038; Portmann NHS Foundation Trust with EUR 91,000. The foundation is a mental health specialist trust located in London. Back in September 2019, the trust wanted to run a contest where it asked patients at the adult gender identity clinic to provide artwork so they can renovate the clinic building. For this reasons, two emails were mistakenly sent with an open distribution list (one of them was sent to 912 recipients and another to 869 recipients). The emails made it clear that all of the recipients were patients of the clinic. The trust immediately acknowledged this error and tried to recall the emails without success. During the investigation, the ICO determined that the trust had no organizational or technical measures in place that would prevent or mitigate the predictable human errors. The ICO also rated as high the harm done to the affected individuals because the relationship of the affected individuals with the gender identity clinic is classified as very sensitive personal information.  Because of immediate implementation of security measures and extensive cooperation with the ICO, the fine was reduced from EUR 910,000 to EUR 91,000."

In these complaints, the data subjects complained about the lack of response on their inquiries. Otavamedia explained that some of these privacy requests had not been fulfilled due to a technical problem with the email management. During such an incident, the messages that were received in the privacy inquiry email box had not been forwarded to the customer service representatives. This situation had only been discovered after seven months. However, the DPA also discovered that Otavamedia should have tested the new email system before putting it live so that it could guarantee the response to the requests and the rights of the data subjects. The requests could also be sent analogously but the request form had to be signed by the data subjects for identification purposes. But Otavamedia was not processing the signature data in any other context, so the signature could not be cross-checked. The DPA concluded that Otavamedia had collected an unnecessary amount of data for identification purposes, making the exercise of data subjects’ rights harder by requiring signatures."

The school was ultimately fined because the means used to monitor attendance were disproportionate to the goal itself.

Furthermore, one case of processing activity presented elevated risks since it involved children dependent on the high-school board. Ultimately, the school didn’t observe Art. 35 of the GDPR."

Marriott bought Starwood in 2016, yet the data breach was only identified in 2018, when Marriott notified the ICO about it. During the investigation, the ICO found that Marriott had employed inadequate security check-ups on its systems after acquiring Starwood. Recently, the ICO decided to fine Marriott with £18.4 million (about EUR 20.4 million). When calculating this fine, the ICO took into consideration the company’s absence of prior violations of GDPR regulations, as well as the company’s full cooperation during the investigation, and personal initiative to notify the affected individuals regarding the data breach."

This fine was related to an incident notified in September 2018 by British Airways, involving the user traffic on the official website of the British Airways being diverted to a fraudulent website. This fraudulent website would harvest the customer details of all clients taken there. The personal data of more than 500,000 customers was harvested during the incident. During the ICO’s investigation, it was found that British Airways was mainly to blame for much of the compromised information, due to inadequate security measures, such as log-in, payment card, and travel booking details. The ICO eventually decided to lower the fine to £20 million (about EUR 22,046,000), taking into consideration the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airline industry."

The game operator then implemented the new code which indeed proved to be better than the old one used but &#8211; let&#8217;s be honest, unsurprisingly &#8211; also included a backdoor that allowed the attacker to steal all the data that was on the server which included player details and personal information. The attacker uploaded this information on their website after that. "

The Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) revealed that TIM was fined due to numerous unlawful data processing activities related to marketing and advertising, which included unsolicited promotional calls and prize competitions in which data subjects were entered without consent.One of the reasons for the large fine was the fact that the unlawful data processing activities involved several million individuals. One individual, for example, was called a total of 155 times in a month while TIM refused to add the affected individual on a no-call list even after several requests. The DPA determined that the company lacked control over the call centers and did not have adequate measures to add people to no-call lists.TIM also did not provide accurate and detailed enough privacy policies and data processing policies, and as such consumers were not efficiently informed about the data collected and processed. The company&#8217;s management of data breaches was also not efficient according to Garante.Besides the fine, Garante also imposed 20 corrective measures according to Art. 58(2) GDPR which prohibits TIM from processing marketing-related data of those individuals who have refused to receive promotional calls, individuals who asked to be blacklisted and individuals who are not clients of TIM.The company was also forbidden from using customer data collected from the "

The Data Protection Authority of Hamburg, however, argued that Facebook did not notify the German authority about this appointment, and as such, the fine is valid. The reason the fine was relatively small was that Facebook did, after all, appoint a DPO but failed to notify German authorities. The fine was given to Facebook Germany GmbH, which is the local German branch of the company."

In this sense, the bank went ahead and argued that its decision was the right one since the documentation would be related to repaid loans, which a customer shouldn&#8217;t have the right to access. A data subject alerted the DPA, which demanded that the bank provide copies of the loan documentation to the data subject. The DPA fined the bank (a specific sum is still unknown) taking into consideration the financial institution&#8217;s continued refusal for over a year to deny the right of access to such documentation to over 2.500 customers."

These data subjects were justified in requesting Google to dereference or delete de articles. The Data Protection Authority said that the same principle applies to public persons holding political office, despite some slight differences in protection. Google’s rejection of the dereferencing application breached Art. 17 of the GDPR (fined with €500,000).

Carrefour France also had insufficient and incomplete data regarding the data storage and transfer of data to countries outside the EU.

The same happened to 750,000 users of the carrefour.fr site who were inactive for about five to ten years. The CNIL discovered that Carrefour France required almost every user to offer proof of identity when they requested a right. Though, the CNIL found out that this request for proof of identity was, most times, unjustified, because most affected users were clearly identifiable without the need for proof of identity. What’s more, Carrefour France failed to respond to a couple of requests from individuals who wanted to access their personal data. Moreover, the company did not erase the data requested by several individuals. Lastly, Carrefour France did not respond to several requests from individuals who did not agree to receiving e-mail and SMS advertising from Carrefour France."

The company was ordered to stop transferring the data of European users from Europe to the United States after failing to comply with the EU’s highest court’s 2020 decision that bemoaned the insufficient protection of the data shipped across the Atlantic from American spy agencies. The Irish DPA mentioned that this fine only applies to Facebook, and not Instagram or WhatsApp, which Meta also owns. Meta has 5-6 months to comply with this decision but the official statements claimed that they would appeal the fine and that there would be no service disruption to European users. Meta could also avoid the massive fine if the European Union and American officials close the new data-sharing pact (Data Privacy Framework) that harmonizes the GDPR legislation with US data collection. If Meta is to comply with the Irish DPA’s ruling, Facebook will have to delete vast amounts of user data or move it back in a legal space. Meta has become an easy target for GDPR regulations after several multi-million-dollar fines for data leaks and insufficient user consent."

The insurance agent sent an insurance policy to an unauthorized third party via e-mail. The document contained personal data regarding the subject of the insurance policy, including first names, surnames, residential addresses, and other information. Then, the supervisory authority demanded that the company clarify whether it performed any risk analyses on the data security of natural persons, in connection to the electronic correspondence sent to an unauthorized third party, as this would make it evident that a data breach had occurred. If a data breach does occur, the company responsible is obligated to notify both the DPA and the affected parties. Despite being sent a letter by the supervisory authority asking for explanations on the data breach, the responsible party did nothing to report the data breach to the DPA or inform the affected data subjects about the data breach. Finally, the DPA initiated administrative proceedings, which eventually prompted the company to report the data breach and notify the two affected individuals about the incident."

The electronics company noted that the video surveillance system had been put in place to prevent any criminal activity and to strictly follow the movement of goods in the warehouses. However, the GDPR states that, to prevent theft, milder alternatives need to be considered first, before moving on to video surveillance. Video surveillance should only be used if there are any reasonable suspicions of theft for specific individuals. However, notebooksbilliger.de had no such suspicions, and utilized the video surveillance indefinitely for two years, without limiting its scope to specific individuals. Some video recordings were even retained for 60 days, which is well over the required time period in such cases. Lastly, many customers of notebooksbilliger.de were affected by the video surveillance, as some cameras covered the seating areas, as well."

Clearly, this is an absurd predicament, as the AEPD concluded that the bank did not respect its information obligations according to Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR. The information provided to the customers in the privacy policy was not accurate and consistent, it had vague and imprecise terminology, and failed to offer a clear picture of the nature of the data processing as well as what type of information would be processed. Information on the data subject’s rights and the contact information of the data controller were not offered consistently and accurately. Moreover, the DPA also argues that the customers’ consent was not taken effectively, and that the data controller had processed the customers’ data partly illegally, beyond the required scope. Moreover, various deficiencies in the bank’s systems allowed it to obtain consent from customers who had not expressly offered their consent. The data processing was done without a legal basis, thus breaching Art. 6 GDPR."

Moreover, the company had failed to foresee any such breaches of security, while also foregoing to implement any security measures after the incident to prevent or minimize the risk of future breaches from occurring. As a result, a data subject was the target of insults and social ridicule following the exposure of the recordings on social media, and the security company did nothing to remove it. While the fine is unknown as of now, the DPA listed out the aggravating factors it would take into consideration when applying the fine – (i) the data processor failed to fulfill its obligations to inform the data controller of the breach as per Art. 33 (2) GDPR, (ii) the area of expertise of the company is technical protection, including video surveillance. The DPA also notes that the company in question is a leading company in this domain in Croatia, and as such should hold relevant opinions, advice, and also propose solutions regarding the use of video surveillance systems, setting an example through its conduct."

Through the data controller, small-sized and medium-sized companies could ask for professional advice on technological and digital processes, if they’d previously received a relevant voucher. However, the Italian DPA investigated the data controller and found out that the data of more than 5000 managers who had made themselves available for consultation was freely available on its website. This personal data included names, e-mails, tax numbers, CVs, and even copies of identity cards and health cards in some cases, and all could be downloaded at any time. Moreover, the website made it possible for anyone to download the directorate resolution that had approved this list of managers, which means the data and information of the directors was also publicly visible. The Italian DPA concluded that the directorate resolution was not an adequate nor sufficient legal basis to disclose this online data which resulted in an unlawful data processing."

The data controller in question, a telecommunications company using the services of the IT provider, told the DPA and its users of a potential breach of personal data committed by the IT provider. This was a security breach that led to unauthorized access and the processing of multiple sets of personal data (28,085 data subjects) by hackers. The security breach happened because the IT provider failed to take the adequate security measures that would protect the personal information from being stolen, thus failing to consider the existing risks. The data controller, as a data processor, would have been forced to take adequate technical and security measures in a way that ensured the consistent anonymity of the personal data, including the regular testing, evaluation and the analysis of how effective anti-hacking responses would be, on the off-chance an attack did happen. During its security assessments, the data controller should have taken into consideration specific security risks related to the personal data of the 28,085 data subjects. Because of this failure to implement the adequate security measures, the Croatian DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider. We don’t know the amount of the fine at this moment. However, when implementing the fine, the DPA considered the nature of the IT provider’s business activity, whose role should have been support other companies through informed guidelines, offering solutions regarding the implementation of web applications, and how to design and introduce adequate technical and security measures."

The data controller then went on to describe the crimes in detail.

It was within its rights to inform its customers that, due to these crimes, the former employee would not continue working for the company and could not see to the customers’ needs.

The DPA received four different complaints against the data controller because of unsolicited telephone advertising. The data controller had assumedly done direct marketing with an automated calling system, but without obtaining valid consent from the data subjects who received the marketing calls. More specifically, the data controller had obtained a form of consent for such direct marketing when any customer subscribed to the online magazine on its website. The subscriber was then required to accept the given terms of the subscription and contract, which also included a consent to direct marketing. But this is where the problem occurs. If the customer did not give his consent to the direct marketing, then he could also not subscribe to the magazine. The DPA claimed that the data controller requested and obtained consent in a way that isn’t compliant with the GDPR. Clearly, the data controller had not specifically requested consent for direct marketing, but rather got an apparent consent with a subscription and other contract terms. This form of consent does not constitute a valid form of consent for the purpose of direct marketing. Furthermore, the customers could not exercise their right to object to direct marketing, since the marketing was carried out by an automated system that could not answer specific queries of the customers. Lastly, the magazine publisher had commissioned an advertising call center to carry out this direct marketing, concluding a contract in this sense."

The data controller stated that the video surveillance system was installed for security purposes. The DPA concluded that the data controller had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, but that it would have to take into consideration the interests of the mostly underaged employees, as well.

One of the former employees of the municipality filed a complaint with the DPA against the municipality. More specifically, the former employee complained that the municipality had processed personal data regarding his internet use during working hours. He received, at a later date, a notice of initiation of disciplinary proceedings. The company had accused him of improperly using the company’s resources for private purposes, having accessed Facebook for more than 40 minutes per day, and staying on YouTube for more than 3 hours. During an investigation, the DPA found out that the municipality had been actively monitoring employees’ internet browsing for over a decade, using a certain system of control and filters. They would retain data monthly, and create special reports for their network security purposes. The system would also collect information that was completely irrelevant regarding the employees’ professional activities and, in many cases, concerned the private lives of the individuals in question. The Italian DPA found out that the data controller had violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The data controller should have clearly taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of their Internet network. The Italian DPA pointed out that, despite the company needing to ensure employees don’t use the internet connection for their private use and only focus on their professional goals, this does not condone the total elimination of privacy of the data subjects at the workplace. Additionally, the data controller had failed to adequately inform employees about this collection of Internet history, thus violating its obligations under Article 13 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA investigation identified other violations in the processing of data regarding employees&#8217; requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which had been made using special forms. The form offered by the data controller would be checked and assessed by the head of the organizational unit, and these circumstances led to the unlawful processing of the health data."

One of his data subjects complained to the DPA against the dentist because he refused to treat him after the data subject had told him he had HIV in his medical history form. Apparently, in the dentist&#8217;s clinic, patients would always fill out these forms with their medical history before receiving any medical treatments. These forms contained specific information about any previous or existing infectious diseases like hepatitis, tuberculosis, or HIV. The Italian DPA concluded that this was a violation of the principles of legality. While it was legitimate for the dentist to ask for such information in order to better plan medical treatment, it still wasn’t allowed nor permissible to collect such information and then refuse treatment to the patient."

These data sets included credit terms and residential address information of other customers. The “My Page” section had been used previously for 500 customers, to offer an overview of loans they had taken out with the data controller. Based on its investigations, the DPA discovered that the data controller failed to comply with the GDPR&#8217;s requirements for risk assessments as well as taking the appropriate technical measures regarding the launch of the customer portal. According to the DPA&#8217;s assessment, the security breach would have been preventable if the data controller had previously conducted a risk assessment and review as required by law."

Back in January, the municipality of Rygge was annexed to the municipality of Moss. Therefore, a couple of IT systems from both municipalities were combined in a single, encompassing system. Because of the inadequate security measures, one of the municipality’s health services suffered a data breach in one of its productive systems. This particular system processed personal and health data of ill people who lived in the municipality and used the respective health center. The system was also used for other services related to immunization programs and health checks and follow-ups for pregnant women. Approximately 2000 people were affected by this breach, and because of it, various errors appeared in the vaccine registration. So, this led to an increased risk of data subjects receiving the wrong vaccines. Not only this but their immunization data could have been misfiled in the national immunization registry because of the data breach. Moreover, the health programs for pregnant women also got an error related to the information about the week of pregnant and the motherțs drug use. Finally, health workers in a health service ward could access the patient information without ever needing a special type of access."

The data controller claimed that the cameras had been installed for the purpose of security of the surrounding premises. However, the cameras also captured the employees&#8217; offices in a way that went beyond the original purpose of the surveillance system.

The data controller had equipped its ticket inspectors with body-worn cameras. They had to prevent threatening situations, document any dangerous incidents, and fine people who traveled without valid tickets on the public transportation in Stockholm. The ticket inspectors had to keep the camera on during their shift, and were able to capture all passengers who passed the inspector. Because a couple hundred thousand people use the public transportation daily, this was a major incident of potential data leakage because of the inspectors’ body cam footage that captured all these people. While the DPA understands how the body-worn surveillance system technology could prevent threatening situations, the pre-recording time should still be reduced to 15 seconds at best. Any longer than that and the recording becomes redundant and goes above the purpose of the body cam footage. The DPA also discovered that the audio recordings weren’t used to identify the individuals with no valid tickets. So, the DPA stated that capturing the audio recordings was a violation of the principles of transparency, data minimization, and legality. The DPA also firmly criticized the data controller for failing to provide adequate information about the camera surveillance, including the fact that both sounds and images were recorded."

These violations included a clear lack of transparency regarding the algorithms used to manage drivers, both during the assignment of jobs and when they booked work shifts. Deliveroo had been using a centralized system to manage its drivers, but the system also processed the assignment of orders and the booking of work shifts. However, Garante noticed that the data controller failed to properly inform its drivers about how the system they had installed on their smartphones worked, and also failed to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the algorithmic systems they used to evaluate the drivers. Additionally, Garante also found that Deliveroo had underwent a detailed assessment of the drivers&#8217; work performance &#8211; through the continuous geolocation of their device, which was disproportionate to the assignment of the order (e.g., recording the drivers’ position every 12 seconds) &#8211; and through the retainment and storage of a certain amount of personal data the company collected during the execution of the orders, including any communication with customer service. In this sense, the company failed to mention or define the storage period of the personal data they had collected from the drivers. Instead, the data controller had only defined a flat storage period of six years. Moreover, Garante discovered that the data controller had failed to implement the necessary technical and organizational measures that would ensure adequate security of the data processing.

            "summary": "The French DPA (also known as CNIL) has fined MONSANTO with EUR 400,000. Back in May 2019, several media outlets revealed that MONSANTO possessed a file that contained the personal data of more than 200 political figures or members of civil society (e.g., scientists, farmers, journalists, or environmental activists) who would most likely be influential in the public debate regarding the renewal and authorization of glyphosate across Europe. The CNIL also received seven complaints from various data subjects affected by this file. For each of these individuals, the aforementioned file contained information regarding the organization the data subjects belonged to, the position they held, their cell phone number, business email address, business address, business phone number, and even Twitter accounts. Additionally, CNIL stated that each person had been assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their credibility, support, and influence for Monsanto on several issues. The DPA believes that the company had critically violated the regulations of the GDPR by failing to inform the data subjects that their personal data was processed and stored in this file. Furthermore, the CNIL claimed that the company had foregone the contractual guarantees which would have regulated the relationships between the company and other subcontractors. Still, creating contact files for lobbying purposes by stakeholders is not illegal. But the data subjects were still within their rights to be informed about their data being in this file, in order to exercise other rights, such as the right to object to the data storage. Moreover, the CNIL discovered that the data collection had been carried out by a data provider that Monsanto had contracted, though in violation of Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation because it failed to include in its contracts with the data processor the provisions stated in the GDPR, more specifically the provisions regarding data security."

The data controller had previously installed facial recognition systems in many Mercadona stores to track individuals with criminal convictions or restraining orders. However, the system also captured everyone who entered the stores, including minors and employees of MERCADONA. During the investigation, the DPA discovered numerous privacy violations. For example, the system violated the principle of data minimization, and the principle of necessity and proportionality. Apparently, the data controller would process multiple biometric data that went beyond the purpose of the system. Additionally, the DPA claimed that Mercadona&#8217;s privacy impact assessment was insufficient because it failed to take into account the specific risks to Mercadona&#8217;s employees, which were posed by data processing through the facial recognition systems. Moreover, MERCADONA had also violated its duty to inform accordingly by by failing to properly provide data subjects with information about the personal data processing. The original fine of EUR 3,150,000 consisted of EUR 500,000 associated with a violation of Art. 5(1)(c), EUR 2,000,000 associated with a violation of Art. 6, and Art. 9 of the GDPR, EUR 100,000 associated with a violation of Art. 12 and Art. 13 of the GDPR, EUR 500,000 associated with a violation of Art. 25(1) of the GDPR, and EUR 50,000 associated with a violation of Art. 35 of the GDPR.

Moreover, the physical flyers also contained a signature bottom on the bottom that not only acted as a confirmation in the enrollment to the club, but also a consent to the data profiling (which wasn’t stated as such). The DPA concluded that the data controller violated its duty as a data controller to provide consent and clarification in an understandable and easily accessible form in clear and simple language. As such, the DPA deemed the consents to be invalid, and the profiling that had been performed based on these consents were unlawful."

However, to use this application on a mobile device, the workers had to provide location data. The data collection took place automatically when the workers clocked in, and it was an in-built feature of the app. Without this feature, the workers couldn’t clock in. Based on the information provided by the data controller, this location data was not used nor exploited in any specific way, but rather it was only processed when the workers clocked in, for technical reasons. However, the simple fact that the app doesn’t allow workers to clock in without collecting their location data doesn’t make it a necessity to collect that data. The company could have devised the app differently. At that point, the Finnish DPA concluded that the company had violated data collection principles as well as the principle of data minimization, since it wasn’t necessary to collect location data."

On the 12th of June, 2020, the DPA was notified by the region regarding a personal data security breach as per Art. 33 GDPR. According to the region, all staff and patients at a lifestyle center could access a building where approximately 100,000 physical patient records were stored. These records included health information and personal identity number details. This data breach took place because both staff and patients had received key cards that allowed them to access all three buildings of the lifestyle center, even though the users may not require to use them. Additionally, passersby could see the covers of some records though a window on the building. These covers showed personal data such as identity numbers and names. Therefore, the DPA concluded that the Midtjylland Region had failed to take adequate security measures to store the personal data. Moreover, the region had further failed to establish enough guidelines for access restrictions when creating the security key cards, and had also failed to conduct the necessary periodic testing, assessment, and evaluation of the security measures it had taken. In assessing the question of whether a fine should be imposed, the Danish DPA took into account, as an aggravating factor, that the region processed large amounts of sensitive data, such as health data."

In another case, a customer had received an advertising call on his mobile phone number and told Vodafone that he did not want to receive more advertising calls.

Back on the 19th of August, 2020, the DPA received a notification from Favrskov Municipality regarding a personal data breach under Art. 33 GDPR. The notification claimed that, during a break-in at the municipality&#8217;s premises, a laptop had been stolen that contained a program which provided overviews of the municipality&#8217;s care facilities and information about the names and personal identity numbers of more than 100 individuals with mental or physical disabilities. The specific computer hard drive was unencrypted and the program, which contained sensitive and private personal data, wasn’t equipped with any security measures. While investigating the case, the DPA discovered that the Favrskov Municipality had failed to ensure the encryption of the laptops’ hard drives for a long time before August 12, 2020, which resulted in an inadequate level of security. The DPA considered this to be a violation of Art. 32 GDPR, since the municipality had failed to implement the proper technical and organizational measures that would ensure a level of protection commensurate with the risk."

The region had been using a screening tool to analyze for inadvertent posting of any personal identity numbers on its website. But this tool couldn’t scan any data in PowerPoint presentations. As such, the DPA discovered that the region had failed to implement the proper organizational and technical measures that would ensure the adequate level of protection appropriate to the risk at hand. When assessing the necessity of a fine, the DPA also considered that aggravating factor of the region’s processing of large amounts of personal data, which also included health data."

These special contracts were issued in order to attract potential new customers, and also came with bonus payments for these customers. The data controller made a comparison between contracts concluded by existing customers and potential customers who had previously submitted inquiries for special contracts. The data controller would reject the application for special contract if it was revealed that the application had previously signed a contract with the data controller then switched to another supplier. This was done to avoid any “bonus shopping”, which companies find unprofitable. However, the data controller failed to inform the customers about the data processing involving these comparisons. The DPA then concluded that the data controller had violated the company’s transparency policies and information obligations, since over 500,000 people had been affected in this data breach."

            "summary": "The Norwegian DPA has fined Ferde AS, which is a Norwegian toll company, with EUR 496,000. After receiving a report from NRK, state-owned broadcasting company, the Norwegian DPA started investigating Ferde AS, discovering that the company had been transferring information on passages in various toll rings to a data processor in China. In this context, the DPA started a large-scale investigation into the company, with the purpose of finding out whether the company had implemented measures and routines that could ensure the information security of this information transfer to China. It should be noted that Ferde AS was also responsible for registering passages at toll booths through a chip in the car. If a car had no chip or if the chip wasn’t properly registered, a photo of the car’s license plate would be taken. These images would then be sent to an automatic optical character recognition system that would digitally read the license plate. If the image wasn’t clear enough, it would go through manual processing. Ferde AS had contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS) to do this job. During the investigation, the DPA found out that the subcontractor also had employees in China. Moreover, Ferde AS had violated many obligations under the GDPR for 1-2 years. In on instance, Ferde failed to conduct a risk management assessment before the processing of personal data and the processing of manual images. This risk assessment was necessary to assess any underlying risks associated with the data transfer, and to also determine whether further security measures should be taken. Additionally, the DPA discovered that Ferde did not enter an official processor contract with UBS. Therefore, the transfer of personal data to China occurred without a legal basis. When determining the value of the fine, the DPA also considered the large amount of the affected personal data as an aggravating factor. However, the implicated data subjects received no material or immaterial damage, which had a mitigating effect on this whole affair."

Additionally, the attachment contained three forms regarding the illnesses that the data subject had previously reported in connection with a life insurance policy the subject had concluded. On the 29th of November, the same incident took place. The second misdirected e-mail contained, aside from the data subject&#8217;s name, specific questions about a particular pathology, the last name of the data subject’s life insurance doctor, the address of the doctor, and two blank forms related to this pathology that should be filed out by the data subject or his doctor. The DPA further stated that the data controller had failed to notify the data breach in due time, as per Art. 33 GDPR. Moreover, the insurance company failed to comply with its documentation obligation as per Art. 33 (5) GDPR. The DPA also concluded that the data controller did not implement the necessary organizational and technical measures that would ensure the protect of the data subjects’ private information."

Apparently, the draft addresses the fact that Facebook had included specific details on data processing in its terms of service, following the provisions of Art. 6 (1) b) rather than Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR. Some critics call this a loophole that Facebook intelligently uses to bypass the strict GDPR requirements of consent, those of Art. 6 (1) a). On the other hand, the DPC clearly states that the GDPR doesn’t establish any hierarchy of specific legal bases that a company can use to process personal data. However, the DPC further noted that Facebook did not provide any clear information regarding the legal basis it used for the data processing, further emphasizing that Facebook provides discontinuous information. The company also sends users to various texts and documents of the terms of services and data policy. The DPC thus concludes on its draft that Facebook had violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, art. 12 (1) GDPR, and Art. 13 (1) c). This draft decision has been forwarded to other European data protection authorities."

Apparently, the data subject saw that a video surveillance system had been installed in the accommodation. This video surveillance system recorded, among others, the connecting corridor  between the accommodation and the communal showers. This footage was recorded and displayed in real time on the staff’s monitors, thus creating a risk that the footage could be seen by suppliers or the visitors. During the DPA’s investigation, the administration of the institution argued that they had installed the video surveillance system to combat theft and provide adequate safety to the residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic. However, the DPA stated that the institute had violated the principles of transparency, lawfulness, and data minimization. Even though the institution claimed that the quality of the footage showing the passage of the residents to the shower room was not clear enough and also of a short duration, the DPA states it was still unlawful. The DPA also claims that the institute could have ensured the safety of its residents in other, less invasive ways that would not restrict the freedoms of the data subjects, referring to a temporary switch-off of the cameras when filming the corridor to the shower rooms, or ensuring the security of these locations through other measures aside from video surveillance. Moreover, the DPA states that the institute failed in properly informing its residents about the video surveillance. They only provided information about the surveillance system to their residents after the DPA investigation had formally begun. Ironically, the information they offered wasn’t suitable for blind or visually impaired people. Instead, the institute should have provided its residents with pre-recorded audio-messages that the residents could listen to."

During the emergency situation of the Covid-19 pandemic where students couldn’t take live exams and in person, the university acquired a remote monitoring software called Respondus, from the American company called Respondus Inc. This software would monitor the students’ behavior via video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. Additionally, the exam was also audio-visually recorded, and the students had their photographs taken at the beginning of the exam. When the exam finished, the system would process the video and insert warning signals attached to each video, regarding potential indications of incorrect behavior (foul play). Among others, the system assigned “review priorities” to various videos so the examiner could further analyze whether there was any foul play in the video. During an investigation, the DPA discovered that the students hadn’t been informed about the processing of their personal data via Respondus. For instance, the students hadn’t been informed that they would be audio-visually recorded, and that these images would then be processed. Moreover, the students weren’t provided with any information regarding the retention period of this data. They also weren’t given enough information about whether or not their data would be transferred to the United States. Instead, they were only told that their data would be processed both inside and outside the European Union. Moreover, the DPA also found that even the information provided to the students had been chaotic and disorganized, placed in multiple documents in a fragmented form. This is a clear violation of the principles of fairness, transparency, and lawfulness, according to the DPA. The DPA also found that the university had processed this personal data without a proper legal basis. They needed to obtain the consent of the students regarding this personal data, before they participated in the exams. Alternatively, the university proposed in-person exams but the pandemic meant that this option presented certain health risks. The students also thought that refusing to take the online exams would clearly impact their grades. So, the DPA concluded that the students had not voluntarily given their consent. Moreover, the DPA also discovered that the university had retained the data for 12 months, despite this not being necessary for the purpose of making sure that the exams were valid. Finally, the DPA also discovered several violations regarding the transfer of data to Respondus. Namely, the processing agreement between Respondus and the university relied on the data protection agreement between the USA and the EU, the Privacy Shield agreement, which had previously been invalidated by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Thus, the DPA concluded that the university unlawfully transferred the personal data of the students to a third country, despite this not being compliant with the conditions stipulated in Chapter V of the GDPR."

The DPA received numerous complaints from people claiming that they’d received unsolicited telemarketing calls and SMS messages from Sky Italia directly and via various call centers of other companies. So, the DPA started investigating the phenomenon. They found out that Sky Italia had made the calls without properly informing the users how they got their hands on the data subject’s personal data. If Sky Italia had done this, the data subjects could have opposed to the data processing by contacting the company who had their data and objecting to the data processing. If the data subjects gave their consent, only then would Sky Italia be allowed to send them commercial offers. Instead, the company used the personal data obtained from various companies for these promotional purposes. However, despite the fact that the data subjects had given their consent to the disclosure of their data to said third party companies, Sky Italia had no right to acquire these lists of personal information and use them for its own promotional purposes. Additionally, Sky Italia also failed to check the list of individuals who had objected to the data processing regarding the advertising messages. Instead, the company proceeded with the marketing calls without taking this into account. Several data subjects who had objected to the data processing ended up receiving advertising calls. Moreover, the DPA discovered that Sky Italia did not appoint its data suppliers as data processors. When calculating the fine, the DPA considered the fact that Sky Italia’s violations implicated a “systemic” conduct that was integral to the company’s other operations, as well as the fact that the company should have made better decisions considering its experience and competence. Given its long-term presence in the market and constant contact with the authorities, Sky Italia should have known better."

Back in May 2020, the CNIL received a complaint from a trade union alleging that promotion decision files included the number of strike days exercised by staff. The CNIL then investigated several RATP bus centers. This way, the CNIL confirmed that this was true in three of the RATP bus centers. The French DPA further confirmed that files referring to performance evaluations and prospects should only even contain data that was necessary for evaluating employees during work hours. More specifically, it would have been sufficient that these files indicated the total number of days of absence without detailing and distinguishing between days of absence and days where the workers exercised their right to strike. The CNIL discovered that the data related to the number of days the staff members were on strike haven’t been used for the right purpose, so the RATP had violated the principle of data minimization as per Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA also found that the RATP has excessively retained some of the employees’ data. More specifically, the RAPT had retained files regarding the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission had taken place. The data retention term was 18 months after the commissions were held, so the RATP also violated this principle. The CNIL discovered that the RATP hadn’t differentiated between staff authorization levels properly either, allowing more staff members than necessary to retain certain data. In conclusion, the CNIL considered that the RATP failed to implement the appropriate organizational and technical measures to ensure a proper level of protection appropriate for the risk at hand."

            "summary": "The Dutch DPA has fined the airline Transavia with EUR 400,000. In 2019, the airline had suffered a data breach in which a hacker gained access to the company’s systems via two accounts held by the IT department of the company. This may have potentially allowed the hacker to gain access the personal data such as dates of birth, names, email addresses, genders, phone numbers, flight information, and booking numbers of more than 25 million passengers. The DPA discovered that the hacker downloaded the personal information of 83,000 people. In 367 cases, this personal data also included medical information of people who had requested wheelchair transportation or additional services due to being deaf or blind. The DPA further noted that the lack of security measures allowed the hacker to access the company’s systems. Apparently, accessing the airline systems could be done simply by entering the required password. That’s because the systems did not have any multi-factor authentication measures in place. Moreover, the accounts themselves didn’t only have access to the necessary systems but also to other systems as well, which allowed the hacker to gain access to multiple systems of Transavia. The DPA concluded that the airline company Transavia had breached its duty to implement proper technical and organizational measures that would ensure a level of security appropriate to the perceived risk of the data subjects."

Apparently, an unauthorized third party had gained access to the medical database of Vastaamo on two occasions (that we know of), one in December 2018 and the other in March 2019. The attacked had stolen data and left a ransom note on the database servers. Because of insufficient data logging, the DPA couldn’t identify the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses that the attacker used. As for the cause of this data breach, it was most likely an unprotected port on the database where the root user account was not protected by a password. The patient database server was left open to the Internet without firewall protection between November 26th, 2017, and March 13th, 2019. In these circumstances, the DPA concluded that the personal data of the patients wasn’t properly protected against unauthorized and unlawful access, processing, destruction, accidental loss, or damage. The data controller also failed to implement the proper measures that would secure the processing of the personal data. During its investigation, the DPA determined that the data controller had known about the data breach of its patient medical data and about the unauthorized access of the attacker ever since March 2019. The Vastaamo psychotherapy center should have reported the security breach to the patients involved and the DPA as soon as it happened. However, the data controller was very late in meeting this obligation. The fine is composed of EUR 145,600 for breaching Art. 33 (1) GDPR, EUR 145,600 for breaching Art. 34 (1) GDPR, and EUR 316,800 for breaching Art. 5 (1) f) GDPR."

The DPA further discovered that this data breach had taken place because of the company’s failure to comply with its obligation to implement the required organizational and technical measures that would ensure adequate security appropriate to the risk of the data subjects. For instance, the company didn’t appoint a person competent enough to oversee the security and risk management. It also didn’t ensure that accesses to database files were logged and evaluated. Moreover, the company hadn’t encrypted the stored databases. A person with enough technical knowledge could gain full access to the data contained in the file after downloading it. As for the personal codes stored in the database, they were unprotected. The passwords in the database were only encrypted with an algorithm that was determined to be insecure."

            "summary": "The Norwegian DPA has fined Grindr LLC with EUR 6,300,000. Grindr is a location-based social networking app that was designed for bi, gay, trans, and queer people. Back in 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority had filed a complaint against Grindr to the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the platform had shared information about its users’ GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender to other third parties for marketing, without obtaining the consent of the data subjects. As per GDPR, that personal data should have only been shared with consent from the data subjects. However, the DPA discovered during its investigation that the consent collected by Grindr was invalid. Users had to accept a privacy policy when using the app but the policy didn’t explicitly ask them whether they consented to their data being shared to third parties for marketing purposes. Moreover, information about the disclosure of personal data wasn’t immediately clear or accessible to users. The DPA shows that the type of data disclosed could identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. The users would sometimes use this app anonymously without inputting their full name or uploading a photo of them. As for the sexual orientation of the users, it was made part of a special category of personal data that is subject to a special, high level of protection. The DPA concludes that this infringement was particularly serious and it justifies a high fine as a deterrent. GDPR considers that this type of fine should act as a strong deterrent for business models based on behavior-based marketing, which are widespread in the digital economy today."

The CNIL did an online review of these websites and discovered that, despite there being a button to accept the cookies instantly, there was no such button to reject them. To reject the cookies, you had to go through several options, as opposed to one option for accepting the cookies. The CNIL concluded that, in most cases, users accepted the cookies out of convenience rather than because they agreed to it. It also concluded that the way these cookie deposits were designed is an interference with the freedom of consent of internet users, violating Art. 82 of the French Law on Informatics and Freedoms. When determining the fine, the CNIL took into consideration the large number of people who were affected in such an aggravating manner. Additionally, the CNIL also considered the significant profits that the companies could make from advertisements generated indirectly from the data collected through these cookies. The CNIL also pointed out the fact that the authority had previously notified the Google companies of this breach in February 2021. Aside from the fine, the CNIL also issued an order that required the companies to provide all internet users in France with a simple way of rejecting cookies, just as simple as accepting them, within three months of receiving this notification. Otherwise, both companies would have to pay a fine of EUR 100,000 per day of delay."

More specifically, the DPA found out that the Council had violated Art. 13 GDPR regarding its relation to the processing of data using traffic cameras. The Council did not provide any information on the identity of the data controller, the contact details of the data protection officer, the purposes for the data processing, or the authorities from which further information could be obtained, as required by Art. 13 GDPR. Additionally, the Council did not provide any information in an easily accessible manner such as signs near the video surveillance cameras. Furthermore, the DPA discovered that the Council did not post a video surveillance policy in a plan and understandable language, in an easily-accessible place on the Council’s website. Therefore, the DPA concluded that the Council had infringed on Art. 12 GDPR. The Council further denied requests for personal data access that was processed by surveillance cameras during traffic management.

An organizational unit of the university had used an application created by the staff of the university to register for courses and access assessments of exam results, teaching history, and billing of fees. Back in January 2020, an unauthorized third party had downloaded a database from this application that contained the personal data of students and faculty staff (more than 5,000 individuals). During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the Warsaw University of Technology did not implement the required organizational and technical measures that would ensure a proper level of security of the personal data. The DPA also discovered that the university did not conduct a formal risk assessment of the program."

These notices contained sensitive data of the organizer of the demonstrations and the demonstrators themselves. This data revealed the political opinions, philosophical beliefs, religious beliefs, and sexual orientations of the data subjects. The DPA discovered that the transfer of this data wouldn’t have been necessary for the involved entities to properly perform their public tasks. Therefore, the processing of the personal data was illegal. Additionally, the DPA discovered that the municipality had undergone the data processing without informing the data subjects, without establishing a policy regarding the retention of their personal data, and without conducting a preliminary data protection impact assessment."

The regional board had sent this sensitive personal data and identity numbers via email. The transmission itself was encrypted, but the information inside the emails wasn’t. The emails contained patient data that was automatically directed to health administrators in the region. Some patient data was manually sent to physicians and researchers in the region. Therefore, the DPA concluded that the regional board had taken insufficient organizational and technical measures to protect the data from any unauthorized access."

Back in 2018, the NGO had published an analysis to help identify the political origins of tweets that were circulating on a heated controversy in France, the “Benalla affair”. During the analysis, the NGO had processed the data of 55,000 Twitter individuals. 3,300 of these had been classified as political. The information obtained from these accounts was published without taking minimal security precautions (anonymizing the data). The DPA noticed that the publication of this data could expose the data subjects to discrimination or discreditation because of the non-anonymous political profiling. Additionally, these files contained information about the data subjects’ sexual orientations, religious beliefs, and ethnic origins.

            "summary": "The Belgian DPA has fined IAB Europe with EUR 250,000. The DPA had previously received many complaints against IAB Europe ever since 2019. Regarding this complaint, the DPA questioned the compliance of IAB Europe with the “Transparency &#038; Consent Framework (TCF). The TCF had been developed by IAB to promote compliance with the GDPR through organizations that used the OpenRTB protocol. This protocol is used for “real-time bidding” like the automated online auctions of user profiles regarding the purchase and sale of advertising space on the web. Users would visit websites that contain ad space that technology companies can bid for in real time through automated auction systems. This was done to display personalized advertising to users. Upon visiting a website for the first time, an interface would appear asking users for consent to the collection, sharing, and other types of processing of their personal information. During this process, the TCF employs a specific consent management tool that allows users to reject certain types of data processing. This TCF remembers the users’ preferences via the consent management tool by generating a TC string and sending it to everyone that participates in the OpenRTB system. This TC string allows user profiles to be compiled and sent to advertisers. The advertisers will see the types of data processing that the users have agreed to. The DPA noticed that the IAB had violated several of the GDPR regulations during the investigation. It discovered that these TC strings already contained personal data, which required a legal basis for its processing, which IAB did not have. IAB couldn’t prove that it had any legal basis to process these TC strings, though. For instance, when users were informed about the data processing, the information provided to them was far too generic and vague to properly understand the purpose of the data processing. Moreover, IAB did not maintain any register of its data processing activities and had also failed to appoint a data protection officer. It also did not conduct any data protection impact assessment."

The AEPD had previously received a complaint from a certain trade union against the Amazon Road Transport Spain company. The company quired certificates that confirmed the absence of criminal records when it hired drivers. Amazon Road though that these certifications weren’t under the umbrella of Art. 10 GDPR. However, that wasn’t the case. The AEPD concluded that this data does fall under Art. 10 GDPR. During the investigation, the AEPD concluded that the processing of this data wasn’t compliant with the requirements of Art. 10 GDPR. Therefore, the DPA came to the conclusion that Amazon Road had processed the data regarding the absence of criminal record without a valid legal basis."

The data subject also requested a copy of the personal data of the company, including a copy of the video surveillance footage narrowed to a specific time and area. However, the energy company denied this request, justifying by: (i) a lack of a written request by the competent authorities to deliver this footage, (ii) the lack of a justified purpose for the request, and (iii) the claim that offering a copy of this footage would negatively affect the rights and freedoms of the petrol station’s customers and personnel. After the DPA issued its general opinion and claimed that the energy company is under legal obligation to provide the surveillance footage to the data subject, the energy company informed the customer that this wasn’t possible. The energy company claimed that the video surveillance footage archives are being erased after seven days. The DPA concluded that the energy company had violated the fundamental rights of the data subject and issued a fine of HRK 940,000,000.

This decision is based on 12 notifications of data breaches that took place between June 7, 2018, and December 4, 2018. The DPC’s investigations ended with Meta being charged with a violation of Art. 5 (2) GDPR and Art. 24 (1) GDPR. During the investigation, the DPC found out that Meta could not prove that it had taken the necessary organizational and technical measures that would protect the data of EUR users. The fine proceedings were carried out with cross-border data processing, and that’s why a decision was only met through the co-decision procedure under Art. 60 GDPR, involving all the European advisory authorities. Although two other European DPAs objected to the draft decision of the DPC, a consensus was reached in the end. As it stands, the DPC’s decision to fine Meta with EUR 17,000,000 is the collective decision of all the other European DPAs."

The DPA investigated this company after it was revealed that it also enables the search of Italian national and residents, despite having denied this initially. The DPA discovered that the personal data held in the company’s databases were processed unlawfully and without a valid legal basis. Additionally, the DPA also discovered that the company had violated several GDPR principles. For instance, the company had clearly violated the principle of transparency when it failed to properly inform users about the data processing. Clearview had also violated the principle of purpose limitation when it processed the users’ data for purposes other than the ones it had revealed online. Finally, the company also violated the principle of storage limitation because it did not specify a time period for the data storage."

The DPA had previously received many complaints about the manner in which the data controller was handling requests from customers. Clients who wanted to know what type of personal data the data controller stores or to have their data deleted, had to upload and send proof of their identity first. The DPA concluded that it was not necessary to send proof of one’s identity to process these requests. Additionally, the mailing process made it extremely difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights."

During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the National Visa Information System (NVIS) had major security deficiencies. This is a serious matter seeing as though the Foreign Ministry processed around 530,000 visa applications per year over the last 3 years. The personal data processed during those applications was, as it seems, insufficiently protected. This data included sensitive information like name, address, fingerprints, place of residence, country of birth, nationality, and purpose of travel. Because of these inadequate security measures, unauthorized individuals could have accessed the data at any time. The DPA noted that the Foreign Ministry had been aware of this security weakness for quite some time. However, they didn’t do anything to adjust the security system. This is why DPA concludes that the ministry was negligent. It was also found that the Foreign Ministry didn’t adequately inform individuals who applied for visas that their personal data would be shared with third parties. This resulted in a fine of EUR 565,000 being issued to the Dutch Foreign Ministry."

This data included information about the first names, surnames, data on medical examinations and illnesses, social security numbers, and the names of the physicians. During the investigation the CNIL discovered that DEDALUS BIOLOGIE had violated several GDPR regulations. For instance, DEDALUS had violated Art. 29 GDPR by processing more data than was necessary during the processing of two laboratories’ patient data. Moreover, the DPA also discovered that DEDALUS did not implement the necessary organizational and technical measures that would ensure the proper protection of the personal data. This is a clear violation of Art. 32 GDPR by itself. The company did not implement any specific security procedures during the data migration operations. Moreover, the data that was leaked was not stored on an encrypted server either. The DPA also discovered that DEDALUS had not implement authentication for access in the public area of the server. This is the main reason why the data leak took place, in fact. Furthermore, the DPA discovered that none of the contracts established between DEDALUS and its clients complied with the requirements set by the GDPR in Art. 28. The DPA took into consideration the aggravating factors and the seriousness of the violations, as well as the large number of data subjects who had been affected, when imposing the fine."

During the investigation, the DPA discovered several violations of the GDPR but the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. The data controller had been keeping a list of indications of fraud for several years. This list contained information on more than 270,000 data subjects, including minors. The administration had processed the personal data, which included citizenship, health, and criminal personal data, as part of the list maintenance. The DPA initially discovered that the administration had no valid legal basis to process this personal data. As such, the data gathered had been processed unlawfully. Moreover, the DPA discovered that the information in this list was also incorrect at times, where many individuals had been falsely registered as possible fraudsters. Additionally, the investigation also revealed that the maintenance of this list resulted in the discrimination against several data subjects. The risk of fraud was also determined based on the nationality and appearance of some of the data subjects. For instance, donations to mosques were considered a risk factor for fraud in the administration’s list. Moreover, the DPA discovered that the administration had violated its obligations to implement the necessary organizational and technical measures that would properly protect the collected personal data. As such, the administration had not adequately secured the personal data of the data subjects. The DPA found out that the administration had also violated the principle of storage limitation by keeping this data for longer than was necessary and contrary to the retention period set by the administration itself. The DPA also found out that the processing of this personal data was not necessary for the administration to perform its duties, so the data processing was disproportionate to the claimed purpose. Also, the administration hadn’t clearly defined the posers for the data processing, violating the principle of data limitation as a result. The fine consists of: EUR 1 million for breaching Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR; EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR; EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) d) GDPR; EUR 250,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) e) GDPR; EUR 500,000 for a breach of Art. 32 (1) GDPR EUR 450,000 for a breach of Art. 35 (2) GDPR."

The company has a search service that allows individuals to be identified based on the biometric data that is extracted from these images. The profiles of these individuals can be further improved with information associated with these images, like image tags and geolocation. Clearview AI doesn’t offer these services in the UK but it does offer them in other countries, so the personal data of UK residents is still used. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the personal data contained within the company’s databases was processed unlawfully without a valid legal basis. Moreover, when the data subjects wanted to exercise their rights under the GDPR, such as the right governed by Art. 15 GDPR, they had to submit more personal data in the form of a photograph that may be matched with the Clearview database. According to the DPA, this is a significant obstacle and deterrent in the exercise of the rights. Additionally, the DPA discovered that the company had violated several of the GDPR principles. For instance, the company had clearly violated the principle of transparency because it failed to adequately inform users about the data processing of their personal data. Clearview also violated the principle of storage limitation because it did not provide a data retention policy, failing to ensure that the data was held for longer than necessary. Finally, Clearview AI did not conduct a privacy impact assessment despite the obvious high risk to the data subjects’ data."

In spring and summer of 202, several security incidents had occurred in the agency’s systems, leading to the loss of data records. These losses led to several proceedings being initiated against several residents regarding the reduction of their cash benefits. A few residents were also reported for non-compliance with the provisions of the Foreigners act. The DPA also discovered that a lack of organizational and technical measures was at fault for allowing these incidents to occur. For example, the agency had not made sufficient backups of data processed data even though it would have been necessary, considering the potential legal consequences of a loss of data."

Easylife is in the retailing business and sells household items and services/products under the motor, health, supercard, and garden clubs. When clients purchase certain products, the company would make assumptions about the customer’s health condition, and it would offer further products for purchase via phone or SMS that were related to their assumed health condition. From the 122 products in the Health Club catalog of Easylife, 80 of them were classified as “trigger products”. Once the clients would purchase these products, Easylife would create their profiles to target them with additional health-related items. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the company had collected and used the personal data (health data) of about 145,500 data subjects without obtaining their consent. The DPA further noted that the “invisible” data processing of the personal data was a serious violation of the data subjects’ rights because they could not exercise their privacy and data protection rights since they did not know about the data processing. Moreover, the company had made a total of 1,345,732 unsolicited marketing calls to individuals without obtaining their consent for the calls. The DPA also noted that this was a violation of the PECR."

            "summary": "The British DPA has fined the construction group Interserve Group Limited with EUR 5,033,000. The data controller had previously notified the DPA about a data breach as per Art. 33 GDPR. Interserve had suffered a cyber attack in the past where the attackers had sent a phishing email to the mailbox of the company’s accounting team. The email had been opened by an employee who also downloaded and opened the zip file contained in the attachment. This made it possible for the attackers to install malware and steal personal data of 113,000 employees. The stolen data contained the social security numbers, bank account information, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and religion of the data subjects. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the attack was made possible because of inadequate security measures. Interserve employees had not been adequately trained on data privacy and the company processes personal data on unsupported operating systems that did not receive security updates anymore, so new system vulnerabilities weren’t covered. Moreover, Interserve had not conducted the adequate vulnerability scans and the information security team did not sufficiently investigate the attack because the antivirus software installed on the systems reported that the malware had been removed."

As a result, the DPA found that the data that was processed as part of this commissioned data processing was done so without a valid legal basis for a long period of time."

During their subsequent investigation, the DPA discovered that the company had contacted the data subjects by telephone for marketing purposes without obtaining their consent first. To this end, the company had used the contacts lists for certain third parties that, in many cases, had not contained any free, specific, informed, or documented consent taken from these users regarding the disclosure of their personal data. The DPA also found that Edison Energia had not provided the data subjects with an easy and direct method of objecting to the processing of their personal data. Moreover, Edison Energia had not responded the data subjects’ requests in a timely manner. What’s more, the DPA also found that the users of the company’s app and website had simultaneously consented to the user of their personal data for profiling and marketing purposes. This type of consent, according to the DPA, does not correspond to a specific or voluntary consent for both purposes simultaneously. In the end, the DPA discovered that Edison Energia had not provided its data subjects with transparent information about the processing of their personal data."

            "summary": "The Irish DPA (also known as DPC) has fined WhatsApp Ireland with EUR 5.5 million. The Austrian Organization “None of Your Business” (NOYB) had complained to the DPA on behalf of a data subject. WhatsApp had recently updated its terms of service shortly after the GDPR came into force. In the ToS, WhatsApp informed its users to click “Agree and Continue” to show that they agree with the new terms of service. This was also required for further access to the messaging service. WhatsApp assumed that this consent to the updated Terms of Service constituted a contract between the user and WhatsApp Ireland because the data processing would have been necessary for the provision and the improvements of the messaging service. The data processing was, therefore, lawful according to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant claimed that WhatsApp was trying to process the users’ data by relying on the fact that this consent was lawful. WhatsApp Ireland actually forced users to consent to the processing of their personal data by making access to its services conditional on the users’ consent to the updated Terms of Service. After the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to the other European supervisory authorities implicated. The DPC discovered that WhatsApp had not relied on user content as a legal basis, which further means that “coerced consent” did not apply in this case. Though, this also did not rule out the possibility that WhatsApp had relied on a contractual basis. As a response, the DPC received objections from 6 supervisory authorities. On the other hand, the DPC discovered that Meta had breached its transparency obligations as per the GDPR. Apparently, Meta had not clearly explained to its users for what purpose and on what legal basis would their personal data be processed. Since they couldn’t reach an agreement on these disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure as per Art. 65 GDPR. When making its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by WhatsApp. Apparently, the EPDB had a different perception than the DPC regarding WhatsApp’s entitlement to rely on the contractual legal basis to process the users’ personal data. The EPDB concluded that WhatsApp had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. So, the DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed a fine of EUR 5.5 million, as well as required WhatsApp to bring its data processing into compliance within 6 months."

That’s because the data controller had not offered the provision of any other type of information to gain access to the sports clubs. It also did not provide the data subjects with any information about potential alternatives to access the sports club.

Moreover, AZOP also found that the data controller had not entered into a data processing agreement with a data processor that monitored simple consumer bankruptcies. This put the data of around 88,896 individuals at risk. This breach persisted for over 2 years. In the end, AZOP discovered that the data controller had not implemented the required organizational and technical measures that would protect the personal data. There were deficiencies in the security system which allowed the insecure processing of personal data on a very large scale, and this resulted in the unauthorized filtering of the data. AZOP also noticed that the breach had been ongoing ever since 2019 and was not addressed. AZOP also took into consideration various aggravating factors such as: the controller’s failure to reasonably cooperate with the DPA during the investigation. Moreover, the data controller had not even informed AZOP of additional measures it had taken to prevent any future risks of identified violations, and it had also not made its privacy policy compliant with the GDPR."

The hospital had previously reported two data breaches to the DPA as per Art. 33 GDPR. In the first case, the neurology department of the hospital had distributed a newsletter in an open distribution list. This resulted in the email addresses of the recipients being visible to all other recipients. Out of the 499 email addresses affected, 321 were related to patients and 46 to family members or caregivers of the patients. This also allowed the individuals to be identified by name. In the second case, the surgical department had sent a newsletter in an open distribution list, so the same problem appeared. Out of the 90 email addresses affected, 75 were related to patients and/or family members or caregivers of the patients, so the recipients could be identified by name. The DPA concluded that this was a violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality. This principle requires that the personal data is processed in a way that ensures the necessary security against unauthorized access. This includes protection against unlawful processing and accidental loss/ destruction or damage, through appropriate organizational and technical measures. Regarding the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating fact that the hospital had introduced several measures to prevent these events specifically, but also the fact that the hospital was highly cooperative with the DPA during the investigation."

Back in September 2019, the trust wanted to run a contest where it asked patients at the adult gender identity clinic to provide artwork so they can renovate the clinic building. For this reasons, two emails were mistakenly sent with an open distribution list (one of them was sent to 912 recipients and another to 869 recipients). The emails made it clear that all of the recipients were patients of the clinic. The trust immediately acknowledged this error and tried to recall the emails without success. During the investigation, the ICO determined that the trust had no organizational or technical measures in place that would prevent or mitigate the predictable human errors. The ICO also rated as high the harm done to the affected individuals because the relationship of the affected individuals with the gender identity clinic is classified as very sensitive personal information.  Because of immediate implementation of security measures and extensive cooperation with the ICO, the fine was reduced from EUR 910,000 to EUR 91,000."

In these complaints, the data subjects complained about the lack of response on their inquiries. Otavamedia explained that some of these privacy requests had not been fulfilled due to a technical problem with the email management. During such an incident, the messages that were received in the privacy inquiry email box had not been forwarded to the customer service representatives. This situation had only been discovered after seven months. However, the DPA also discovered that Otavamedia should have tested the new email system before putting it live so that it could guarantee the response to the requests and the rights of the data subjects. The requests could also be sent analogously but the request form had to be signed by the data subjects for identification purposes. But Otavamedia was not processing the signature data in any other context, so the signature could not be cross-checked. The DPA concluded that Otavamedia had collected an unnecessary amount of data for identification purposes, making the exercise of data subjects’ rights harder by requiring signatures."

The data subject then requested the deletion of their data and the ceasing of the SMS sending. However, the politician did not comply with this request and the SMS continued to be sent."
