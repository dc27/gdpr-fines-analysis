About seven million were residents of the UK. This cyber vulnerability is related to the data breach of the Starwood hotels group in 2014. Marriott bought Starwood in 2016, yet the data breach was only identified in 2018, when Marriott notified the ICO about it. During the investigation, the ICO found that Marriott had employed inadequate security check-ups on its systems after acquiring Starwood. Recently, the ICO decided to fine Marriott with £18.4 million (about EUR 20.4 million). When calculating this fine, the ICO took into consideration the company’s absence of prior violations of GDPR regulations, as well as the company’s full cooperation during the investigation, and personal initiative to notify the affected individuals regarding the data breach."

This fine was related to an incident notified in September 2018 by British Airways, involving the user traffic on the official website of the British Airways being diverted to a fraudulent website. This fraudulent website would harvest the customer details of all clients taken there. The personal data of more than 500,000 customers was harvested during the incident. During the ICO’s investigation, it was found that British Airways was mainly to blame for much of the compromised information, due to inadequate security measures, such as log-in, payment card, and travel booking details. The ICO eventually decided to lower the fine to £20 million (about EUR 22,046,000), taking into consideration the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airline industry."

Still, these attempts were ineffective, and a penalty was issued. The 585 judges had suffered no damage because of this, so the penalty was adjusted by the president of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection."

The attackers blackmailed the operator into paying money for the attacks to stop. As part of the &#8220;deal&#8221;, the attackers offered the operator to create and implement a better firewall protection system that would prevent any future attacks from other parties. The operator agreed to this &#8220;deal&#8221;. The game operator then implemented the new code which indeed proved to be better than the old one used but &#8211; let&#8217;s be honest, unsurprisingly &#8211; also included a backdoor that allowed the attacker to steal all the data that was on the server which included player details and personal information. The attacker uploaded this information on their website after that. "

The culpability of the company was reasonably low to justify this decrease in the fine’s value, due to the fact that the company’s procedure of identifying customers through the hotline by asking only the name and date of birth wasn’t objected by any customer, so the company wasn’t aware of the problem this procedure posed.

Back in May 2020, the Polish DPA was notified by a third party that a data breach occurred at Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń i Reasekuracji WARTA S.A, regarding an insurance agent posing as a processing agent at the company. The insurance agent sent an insurance policy to an unauthorized third party via e-mail. The document contained personal data regarding the subject of the insurance policy, including first names, surnames, residential addresses, and other information. Then, the supervisory authority demanded that the company clarify whether it performed any risk analyses on the data security of natural persons, in connection to the electronic correspondence sent to an unauthorized third party, as this would make it evident that a data breach had occurred. If a data breach does occur, the company responsible is obligated to notify both the DPA and the affected parties. Despite being sent a letter by the supervisory authority asking for explanations on the data breach, the responsible party did nothing to report the data breach to the DPA or inform the affected data subjects about the data breach. Finally, the DPA initiated administrative proceedings, which eventually prompted the company to report the data breach and notify the two affected individuals about the incident."

One of the employees took a picture of the declaration and forwarded it via WhatsApp. Then, the document was also posted on Facebook and another website.

The video cameras covered recreation areas, warehouses, workplaces, and even sales areas. The electronics company noted that the video surveillance system had been put in place to prevent any criminal activity and to strictly follow the movement of goods in the warehouses. However, the GDPR states that, to prevent theft, milder alternatives need to be considered first, before moving on to video surveillance. Video surveillance should only be used if there are any reasonable suspicions of theft for specific individuals. However, notebooksbilliger.de had no such suspicions, and utilized the video surveillance indefinitely for two years, without limiting its scope to specific individuals. Some video recordings were even retained for 60 days, which is well over the required time period in such cases. Lastly, many customers of notebooksbilliger.de were affected by the video surveillance, as some cameras covered the seating areas, as well."

However, the data subjects were not provided with an option to refuse to consent to this. If they disagreed with this action from the bank, they were supposed to send a letter of disagreement to each of the companies in the CaixaBank Group. Clearly, this is an absurd predicament, as the AEPD concluded that the bank did not respect its information obligations according to Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR. The information provided to the customers in the privacy policy was not accurate and consistent, it had vague and imprecise terminology, and failed to offer a clear picture of the nature of the data processing as well as what type of information would be processed. Information on the data subject’s rights and the contact information of the data controller were not offered consistently and accurately. Moreover, the DPA also argues that the customers’ consent was not taken effectively, and that the data controller had processed the customers’ data partly illegally, beyond the required scope. Moreover, various deficiencies in the bank’s systems allowed it to obtain consent from customers who had not expressly offered their consent. The data processing was done without a legal basis, thus breaching Art. 6 GDPR."

Lastly, the DPA concluded that the city of Rome was using the services of a provider for hosting and maintaining databases without a proper agreement as per Art. 28 GDPR."

Through the data controller, small-sized and medium-sized companies could ask for professional advice on technological and digital processes, if they’d previously received a relevant voucher. However, the Italian DPA investigated the data controller and found out that the data of more than 5000 managers who had made themselves available for consultation was freely available on its website. This personal data included names, e-mails, tax numbers, CVs, and even copies of identity cards and health cards in some cases, and all could be downloaded at any time. Moreover, the website made it possible for anyone to download the directorate resolution that had approved this list of managers, which means the data and information of the directors was also publicly visible. The Italian DPA concluded that the directorate resolution was not an adequate nor sufficient legal basis to disclose this online data which resulted in an unlawful data processing."

A series of press reports appeared that raised suspicions with the institute’s data processing practices regarding the application review of politicians, and the Italian DPA formally investigated the INPS in August 2020. The DPA discovered several violations during the investigations. Apparently, the data controller had been collecting data related to tens of thousands of politicians from public sources, which it would crosscheck with data from the applicants. However, the data controller failed to ensure that should only be collected from those politicians who were eligible to receive these assistance funds. Because of this, the DPA concluded that the data controller had violated the principle of transparency, fairness, and lawfulness as set out by the GDPR. Moreover, the data controller had infringed upon the principle of data minimization after it initiated reimbursement checks on individuals who had their applications rejected and who would never receive those reimbursements. Finally, the Istituto Nazionale Previdenza Sociale had not done an impact assessment regarding the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, nor had it assessed the risks of the data processing operation as sensitive as one on applications for social benefits."

More specifically, some of the call centers working for the company Fastweb S.p.A. disregarded any data protection regulations. They would use phone numbers to make calls that were not registered in any Italian register for communication operators. The company had also received contact data for promotions from external partners, which the call centers processed without the consent of the data subjects. Moreover, the users also reported about being contacted by individuals who claimed they were from Fastweb and who tried to obtain the contractors’ identity documents through WhatsApp, most likely for spamming, phishing, and other such fraudulent purposes. One last breach involved the procedures for the “call me back” service, which made it impossible to freely give their informed consent or deactivate the service automatically."

Naturally, these details were more than enough for watchers of the livestream to identify family members, friends, coworkers, etc. The Norwegian DPA decided that the live stream breached Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) GDPR.

The data of more than 50,000 individuals was exposed to the Internet during a test migration to a new platform. The personal data included user names, names, e-mail and postal addresses, units and departments, as well as telephone numbers of the data subjects. The DPA discovered that the data controller failed to take the necessary organizational and technical measures that would ensure the confidentiality of the data processed. Moreover, the contract between the data controller and the company that processed the data failed to comply with the legal requirements. For instance, the contract failed to mention the categories of data that would be processed."

Even after the data subject informed the company of this mistake, he kept receiving mails and messages.

An MRI was performed on the data subject in 2019, for an injury of the right knee. The cost for this examination was covered by the private health insurance of the patient. In the same month of 2019, another MRI had to be performed due to a work-related injury to the same knee, to a different hospital. However, the second hospital’s system linked the first MRI (which was privately-arranged) to the patient’s records at this second hospital. It should be clear that the first MRI had been provided through the hospital network without a medical justification, due to the private nature. This turnaround was unfavorable for the data subject because, when the second MRI came, the doctor told him to contact his private physician or a social insurance regarding this injury, because the accident can’t be considered a work-related accident. The doctor also said that, since the first MRI had a non-occupational cause, the second MRI could not have an occupational cause either."

When trying to open up a new account with the data controller, the data subject was informed that opening an account was not possible because his data was blocked (as a result of the request for data erasure). The data subject was informed that if he wanted to open a new account, the data would have to be unblocked. In this sense, the letter came attached with a form. This form claimed that, upon signing it, the data subject would forfeit his previous request for data erasure, thus allowing the data controller to his data again.

The data controller in question, a telecommunications company using the services of the IT provider, told the DPA and its users of a potential breach of personal data committed by the IT provider. This was a security breach that led to unauthorized access and the processing of multiple sets of personal data (28,085 data subjects) by hackers. The security breach happened because the IT provider failed to take the adequate security measures that would protect the personal information from being stolen, thus failing to consider the existing risks. The data controller, as a data processor, would have been forced to take adequate technical and security measures in a way that ensured the consistent anonymity of the personal data, including the regular testing, evaluation and the analysis of how effective anti-hacking responses would be, on the off-chance an attack did happen. During its security assessments, the data controller should have taken into consideration specific security risks related to the personal data of the 28,085 data subjects. Because of this failure to implement the adequate security measures, the Croatian DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider. We don’t know the amount of the fine at this moment. However, when implementing the fine, the DPA considered the nature of the IT provider’s business activity, whose role should have been support other companies through informed guidelines, offering solutions regarding the implementation of web applications, and how to design and introduce adequate technical and security measures."

In many cases, one parent received the residence address of the other parent, even though the other parent had address and name protection.

The DPA received four different complaints against the data controller because of unsolicited telephone advertising. The data controller had assumedly done direct marketing with an automated calling system, but without obtaining valid consent from the data subjects who received the marketing calls. More specifically, the data controller had obtained a form of consent for such direct marketing when any customer subscribed to the online magazine on its website. The subscriber was then required to accept the given terms of the subscription and contract, which also included a consent to direct marketing. But this is where the problem occurs. If the customer did not give his consent to the direct marketing, then he could also not subscribe to the magazine. The DPA claimed that the data controller requested and obtained consent in a way that isn’t compliant with the GDPR. Clearly, the data controller had not specifically requested consent for direct marketing, but rather got an apparent consent with a subscription and other contract terms. This form of consent does not constitute a valid form of consent for the purpose of direct marketing. Furthermore, the customers could not exercise their right to object to direct marketing, since the marketing was carried out by an automated system that could not answer specific queries of the customers. Lastly, the magazine publisher had commissioned an advertising call center to carry out this direct marketing, concluding a contract in this sense."

However, the room in which they had to change was a storage room that also contained large quantities of cleaning materials. This storage room was too small to allow employees (mostly minors) to change, so they changed in a general employee area (which was filmed by the video surveillance system). The data controller stated that the video surveillance system was installed for security purposes. The DPA concluded that the data controller had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, but that it would have to take into consideration the interests of the mostly underaged employees, as well. The data controller should have tried to implement less restrictive and invasive measures. Additionally, the DPA underlined that the information provided on video surveillance was insufficient in both the employee and customer service areas.

Many data subjects filed complaints with the DPA against the data controller because they had received unsolicited advertising messages that they had never consented to. During its investigation against the data controller, the DPA discovered that the personal data the controller had processed for its telemarketing activities was acquire from external sources and not gathered personally. The data controller also did not check whether the addressees had given their consent for this transfer of data, for the purpose of advertising. The personal data received by Iren Mercato was from one company, who had received it from two other companies in the same way. The latter companies did indeed obtain consent from the potential customers for telemarketing purposes, but they had not given their consent for the customer data transfer to other companies. Therefore, the DPA concluded that the given consent of customers to a company for promotional activities did not automatically extend to other companies through a transfer of personal data."

During the investigation, the Italian DPA discovered very serious violations of applicable data protection regulations. Therefore, the Italian DPA identified a couple of irregularities regarding the algorithms of the Foodinho system. More specifically, the DPA found that the data controller had failed to adequately inform its employees about how the system worked, and it also didn’t guarantee the accuracy of algorithms’ results used to evaluate drivers. Furthermore, the DPA also concluded that the data controller had violated the principles of memory limitation and data minimization. For instance, the company’s systems processed the drivers&#8217; data to an extent that was thoroughly unnecessary and exceeded the purpose of the processing. In some cases, they stored the data significantly longer than was necessary. Additionally, the controller had failed to take the adequate technical and organizational measures that would ensure the secure data processing. The data controller also did not conduct a data protection impact assessment, despite this being clearly necessary because the company was dealing with a considerable amount of customer data. The Spanish DPA are conducting separate proceedings against the mother company, GlovoApp23."

One of the former employees of the municipality filed a complaint with the DPA against the municipality. More specifically, the former employee complained that the municipality had processed personal data regarding his internet use during working hours. He received, at a later date, a notice of initiation of disciplinary proceedings. The company had accused him of improperly using the company’s resources for private purposes, having accessed Facebook for more than 40 minutes per day, and staying on YouTube for more than 3 hours. During an investigation, the DPA found out that the municipality had been actively monitoring employees’ internet browsing for over a decade, using a certain system of control and filters. They would retain data monthly, and create special reports for their network security purposes. The system would also collect information that was completely irrelevant regarding the employees’ professional activities and, in many cases, concerned the private lives of the individuals in question. The Italian DPA found out that the data controller had violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The data controller should have clearly taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of their Internet network. The Italian DPA pointed out that, despite the company needing to ensure employees don’t use the internet connection for their private use and only focus on their professional goals, this does not condone the total elimination of privacy of the data subjects at the workplace. Additionally, the data controller had failed to adequately inform employees about this collection of Internet history, thus violating its obligations under Article 13 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA investigation identified other violations in the processing of data regarding employees&#8217; requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which had been made using special forms. The form offered by the data controller would be checked and assessed by the head of the organizational unit, and these circumstances led to the unlawful processing of the health data."

Based on its investigations, the DPA discovered that the data controller failed to comply with the GDPR&#8217;s requirements for risk assessments as well as taking the appropriate technical measures regarding the launch of the customer portal.

Because of the inadequate security measures, one of the municipality’s health services suffered a data breach in one of its productive systems. This particular system processed personal and health data of ill people who lived in the municipality and used the respective health center. The system was also used for other services related to immunization programs and health checks and follow-ups for pregnant women. Approximately 2000 people were affected by this breach, and because of it, various errors appeared in the vaccine registration. So, this led to an increased risk of data subjects receiving the wrong vaccines. Not only this but their immunization data could have been misfiled in the national immunization registry because of the data breach. Moreover, the health programs for pregnant women also got an error related to the information about the week of pregnant and the motherțs drug use. Finally, health workers in a health service ward could access the patient information without ever needing a special type of access."

They had to prevent threatening situations, document any dangerous incidents, and fine people who traveled without valid tickets on the public transportation in Stockholm. The ticket inspectors had to keep the camera on during their shift, and were able to capture all passengers who passed the inspector. Because a couple hundred thousand people use the public transportation daily, this was a major incident of potential data leakage because of the inspectors’ body cam footage that captured all these people. While the DPA understands how the body-worn surveillance system technology could prevent threatening situations, the pre-recording time should still be reduced to 15 seconds at best. Any longer than that and the recording becomes redundant and goes above the purpose of the body cam footage. The DPA also discovered that the audio recordings weren’t used to identify the individuals with no valid tickets. So, the DPA stated that capturing the audio recordings was a violation of the principles of transparency, data minimization, and legality. The DPA also firmly criticized the data controller for failing to provide adequate information about the camera surveillance, including the fact that both sounds and images were recorded."

This recording was disproportionate to the purpose of the security surveillance. The DPA concluded that the data controller had violated the principle of data minimization under Article 5 (1) c) GDPR. Moreover, the data controller failed to inform the data subjects (employees) about the recording/data processing, violating its duty to inform."

The Region of Syddanmark had kept at the time a database for research and clinical purposes for a period of more than 1.5 years. However, the database inadequately secured against unauthorized access by unknown individuals. Through a manipulation of URLs, everyone could technically gain access to PDF documents stored in the database. This allowed all citizens who were registered in the database &#8211; and who also had login information to the database &#8211; to access the personal data of all the individuals registered in the database.

However, Garante noticed that the data controller failed to properly inform its drivers about how the system they had installed on their smartphones worked, and also failed to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the algorithmic systems they used to evaluate the drivers. Additionally, Garante also found that Deliveroo had underwent a detailed assessment of the drivers&#8217; work performance &#8211; through the continuous geolocation of their device, which was disproportionate to the assignment of the order (e.g., recording the drivers’ position every 12 seconds) &#8211; and through the retainment and storage of a certain amount of personal data the company collected during the execution of the orders, including any communication with customer service. In this sense, the company failed to mention or define the storage period of the personal data they had collected from the drivers. Instead, the data controller had only defined a flat storage period of six years. Moreover, Garante discovered that the data controller had failed to implement the necessary technical and organizational measures that would ensure adequate security of the data processing.

The CNIL also received seven complaints from various data subjects affected by this file. For each of these individuals, the aforementioned file contained information regarding the organization the data subjects belonged to, the position they held, their cell phone number, business email address, business address, business phone number, and even Twitter accounts. Additionally, CNIL stated that each person had been assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their credibility, support, and influence for Monsanto on several issues. The DPA believes that the company had critically violated the regulations of the GDPR by failing to inform the data subjects that their personal data was processed and stored in this file. Furthermore, the CNIL claimed that the company had foregone the contractual guarantees which would have regulated the relationships between the company and other subcontractors. Still, creating contact files for lobbying purposes by stakeholders is not illegal. But the data subjects were still within their rights to be informed about their data being in this file, in order to exercise other rights, such as the right to object to the data storage. Moreover, the CNIL discovered that the data collection had been carried out by a data provider that Monsanto had contracted, though in violation of Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation because it failed to include in its contracts with the data processor the provisions stated in the GDPR, more specifically the provisions regarding data security."

            "summary": "The Spanish DPA (also known as AEPD) has fined Mercadona S.A. with EUR 2,520,000. The data controller had previously installed facial recognition systems in many Mercadona stores to track individuals with criminal convictions or restraining orders. However, the system also captured everyone who entered the stores, including minors and employees of MERCADONA. During the investigation, the DPA discovered numerous privacy violations. For example, the system violated the principle of data minimization, and the principle of necessity and proportionality. Apparently, the data controller would process multiple biometric data that went beyond the purpose of the system. Additionally, the DPA claimed that Mercadona&#8217;s privacy impact assessment was insufficient because it failed to take into account the specific risks to Mercadona&#8217;s employees, which were posed by data processing through the facial recognition systems. Moreover, MERCADONA had also violated its duty to inform accordingly by by failing to properly provide data subjects with information about the personal data processing. The original fine of EUR 3,150,000 consisted of EUR 500,000 associated with a violation of Art. 5(1)(c), EUR 2,000,000 associated with a violation of Art. 6, and Art. 9 of the GDPR, EUR 100,000 associated with a violation of Art. 12 and Art. 13 of the GDPR, EUR 500,000 associated with a violation of Art. 25(1) of the GDPR, and EUR 50,000 associated with a violation of Art. 35 of the GDPR. The original fine was reduced to EUR 2,250,000 due to voluntary payment."

According to the GDPR, the information provided must be easily accessible understood. However, the data controller had designed the registration procedure for the jö Bonus Club in a way that the clarification about the data usage and profiling was only accessible after scrolling down. But the consent was located higher up, so in all cases, the customers would give the consent before reading the clarification. Moreover, the physical flyers also contained a signature bottom on the bottom that not only acted as a confirmation in the enrollment to the club, but also a consent to the data profiling (which wasn’t stated as such). The DPA concluded that the data controller violated its duty as a data controller to provide consent and clarification in an understandable and easily accessible form in clear and simple language. As such, the DPA deemed the consents to be invalid, and the profiling that had been performed based on these consents were unlawful."

However, to use this application on a mobile device, the workers had to provide location data. The data collection took place automatically when the workers clocked in, and it was an in-built feature of the app. Without this feature, the workers couldn’t clock in. Based on the information provided by the data controller, this location data was not used nor exploited in any specific way, but rather it was only processed when the workers clocked in, for technical reasons. However, the simple fact that the app doesn’t allow workers to clock in without collecting their location data doesn’t make it a necessity to collect that data. The company could have devised the app differently. At that point, the Finnish DPA concluded that the company had violated data collection principles as well as the principle of data minimization, since it wasn’t necessary to collect location data."

Apparently, the institution had sent medical documents belonging to a patient to another person, by mistake. The data controller claims that this incident took place because of a printing process. Out of two printers present at the ward where the affected patient was being treated, one had preloaded medical health data of another patient, which a doctor sent to his print job (documents of the wrong recipient)."

When the data subject was scheduled to arrive, a concierge copied the data subject’s data despite not being authorized to do this. The concierge should only have verified the data subject’s reservation and give the data subject the keys to the room. After the provided the concierge with his personal data, the data subject noticed that his personal data was published on a website with online content for adults. Therefore, the DPA concluded that the data controller didn’t show enough diligence in taking care of its clients’ personal data, violating Art. 29 (3) GDPR. The fine is composed proportionally of EUR 2,000 for a breach of Art. 22(2) LSSI and 5,000 EUR for a breach of Art. 28(3) GDPR. However, the original fine of EUR 7,000 was reduced to EUR 4,200 due to the immediate payment and admission of guilt."

According to the region, all staff and patients at a lifestyle center could access a building where approximately 100,000 physical patient records were stored.

This data breach took place because both staff and patients had received key cards that allowed them to access all three buildings of the lifestyle center, even though the users may not require to use them. Additionally, passersby could see the covers of some records though a window on the building. These covers showed personal data such as identity numbers and names. Therefore, the DPA concluded that the Midtjylland Region had failed to take adequate security measures to store the personal data.

            "summary": "The Italian DPA (also known as Garante) has fined Roma Capitale with EUR. The DPA had previously launched an investigation after an individual had complained to the authority about the newest parking meters installed in the city in 2018. In fact, the company who managed the parking lots and who was contracted by the city, Atac s.p.a., had performed a technical upgrade of the parking meters to provide new services (such as the payment of fines/fees or the purchase/renewal of public transport tickets) and introduce new payment methods that could also take into account the vehicle&#8217;s license plate number. Some of the equipment had been supplied by another company called Flowbird Italia s.r.l. All the parking information was then pooled and managed through a centralized system that could also be accessed through an app by any employees responsible for managing parking fees. The DPA investigation found some irregularities with this process. The city of Rome, as the data controller, had failed to provid information on the processing of the drivers&#8217; data, failed to designate the company Atac as its data processor, and has also failed to provide the necessary instructions to process the data collected. Also, the subcontractor that the city had hired did not receive any formal instructions on how to proceed with the data processing. It was also discovered that the companies had failed to establish a data processing register. Moreover, the retention periods for the collected data had not been specified, and appropriate security measures had not been taken. For instance, the DPA found out that, at the time of the audit, some data leaks going to and from the system installed by Atac had been going through insecure channels. Additionally, officials of the city could have easily checked any license plate en masse and repeatedly to, say, find out a person&#8217;s parking location and habits. When calculating the fine for this unlawful data processing, the DPA took into account and aggravating factor, that of the large amount of personal data processed (from June 2018 to November 2019, the system established by Atac had already finished collecting the data of approximately 8,600,000 stops. This could potentially affect all users of the paid parking service in the city area), as well as the sanctions already received for data protection violations, but also the helpful cooperation offered by the city officials and the companies to remedy some violations detected during the inspection."

The fine relates to data matching, which the data controller had carried out between August 2018 and December 2019 in the course of contract inquiries for special contracts. These special contracts were issued in order to attract potential new customers, and also came with bonus payments for these customers. The data controller made a comparison between contracts concluded by existing customers and potential customers who had previously submitted inquiries for special contracts. The data controller would reject the application for special contract if it was revealed that the application had previously signed a contract with the data controller then switched to another supplier. This was done to avoid any “bonus shopping”, which companies find unprofitable. However, the data controller failed to inform the customers about the data processing involving these comparisons. The DPA then concluded that the data controller had violated the company’s transparency policies and information obligations, since over 500,000 people had been affected in this data breach."

            "summary": "The Norwegian DPA has fined Ferde AS, which is a Norwegian toll company, with EUR 496,000. After receiving a report from NRK, state-owned broadcasting company, the Norwegian DPA started investigating Ferde AS, discovering that the company had been transferring information on passages in various toll rings to a data processor in China. In this context, the DPA started a large-scale investigation into the company, with the purpose of finding out whether the company had implemented measures and routines that could ensure the information security of this information transfer to China. It should be noted that Ferde AS was also responsible for registering passages at toll booths through a chip in the car. If a car had no chip or if the chip wasn’t properly registered, a photo of the car’s license plate would be taken. These images would then be sent to an automatic optical character recognition system that would digitally read the license plate. If the image wasn’t clear enough, it would go through manual processing. Ferde AS had contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS) to do this job. During the investigation, the DPA found out that the subcontractor also had employees in China. Moreover, Ferde AS had violated many obligations under the GDPR for 1-2 years. In on instance, Ferde failed to conduct a risk management assessment before the processing of personal data and the processing of manual images. This risk assessment was necessary to assess any underlying risks associated with the data transfer, and to also determine whether further security measures should be taken. Additionally, the DPA discovered that Ferde did not enter an official processor contract with UBS. Therefore, the transfer of personal data to China occurred without a legal basis. When determining the value of the fine, the DPA also considered the large amount of the affected personal data as an aggravating factor. However, the implicated data subjects received no material or immaterial damage, which had a mitigating effect on this whole affair."

About seven million were residents of the UK. This cyber vulnerability is related to the data breach of the Starwood hotels group in 2014. Marriott bought Starwood in 2016, yet the data breach was only identified in 2018, when Marriott notified the ICO about it. During the investigation, the ICO found that Marriott had employed inadequate security check-ups on its systems after acquiring Starwood. Recently, the ICO decided to fine Marriott with £18.4 million (about EUR 20.4 million). When calculating this fine, the ICO took into consideration the company’s absence of prior violations of GDPR regulations, as well as the company’s full cooperation during the investigation, and personal initiative to notify the affected individuals regarding the data breach."

This fine was related to an incident notified in September 2018 by British Airways, involving the user traffic on the official website of the British Airways being diverted to a fraudulent website. This fraudulent website would harvest the customer details of all clients taken there. The personal data of more than 500,000 customers was harvested during the incident. During the ICO’s investigation, it was found that British Airways was mainly to blame for much of the compromised information, due to inadequate security measures, such as log-in, payment card, and travel booking details. The ICO eventually decided to lower the fine to £20 million (about EUR 22,046,000), taking into consideration the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airline industry."

Amsterdam was fined with €80,000 due to not respecting data protection principles (privacy by design și privacy by default) by not implementing adequate technical measures to ensure the protection of personal data. As a consequence of this, a total of 225,525 had their transactions doubled on debit card payments during the period of 8-10 October 2018.This is one of the bigger fines in Romania, but it&#8217;s interesting to note that for similar offenses in other countries fines of over several millions of Euros are usually awarded. This denotes again the fact that different countries have different approaches to GDPR enforcement."

The Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) revealed that TIM was fined due to numerous unlawful data processing activities related to marketing and advertising, which included unsolicited promotional calls and prize competitions in which data subjects were entered without consent.One of the reasons for the large fine was the fact that the unlawful data processing activities involved several million individuals. One individual, for example, was called a total of 155 times in a month while TIM refused to add the affected individual on a no-call list even after several requests. The DPA determined that the company lacked control over the call centers and did not have adequate measures to add people to no-call lists.TIM also did not provide accurate and detailed enough privacy policies and data processing policies, and as such consumers were not efficiently informed about the data collected and processed. The company&#8217;s management of data breaches was also not efficient according to Garante.Besides the fine, Garante also imposed 20 corrective measures according to Art. 58(2) GDPR which prohibits TIM from processing marketing-related data of those individuals who have refused to receive promotional calls, individuals who asked to be blacklisted and individuals who are not clients of TIM.The company was also forbidden from using customer data collected from the "

Carrefour France also had insufficient and incomplete data regarding the data storage and transfer of data to countries outside the EU. The company also failed to comply with the storage time limits, and it stored the data of more than twenty-eight million customers who had been inactive for five to ten years, for the purpose of its loyalty program. The same happened to 750,000 users of the carrefour.fr site who were inactive for about five to ten years. The CNIL discovered that Carrefour France required almost every user to offer proof of identity when they requested a right. Though, the CNIL found out that this request for proof of identity was, most times, unjustified, because most affected users were clearly identifiable without the need for proof of identity. What’s more, Carrefour France failed to respond to a couple of requests from individuals who wanted to access their personal data. Moreover, the company did not erase the data requested by several individuals. Lastly, Carrefour France did not respond to several requests from individuals who did not agree to receiving e-mail and SMS advertising from Carrefour France."

The Hamburg data protection officer also found that the H&#038;M supervisors obtained general information about its employees “through the grapevine”, such as religious beliefs and family problems. All the information stored on the network drive was made accessible to over 50 managers of H&#038;M, and they used it to evaluate the work performance and efficiency of all employees, as well as make employment decisions. This fact became known when the H&#038;M servers encountered a technical error, and the data on the network drive became accessible to all employees for a few hours. The management subsequently apologized to all affected employees and offered monetary compensation in return for this offence. The data protection authority established more robust protective measures to prevent such incidents from happening again."

Back in May 2020, the Polish DPA was notified by a third party that a data breach occurred at Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń i Reasekuracji WARTA S.A, regarding an insurance agent posing as a processing agent at the company. The insurance agent sent an insurance policy to an unauthorized third party via e-mail. The document contained personal data regarding the subject of the insurance policy, including first names, surnames, residential addresses, and other information. Then, the supervisory authority demanded that the company clarify whether it performed any risk analyses on the data security of natural persons, in connection to the electronic correspondence sent to an unauthorized third party, as this would make it evident that a data breach had occurred. If a data breach does occur, the company responsible is obligated to notify both the DPA and the affected parties. Despite being sent a letter by the supervisory authority asking for explanations on the data breach, the responsible party did nothing to report the data breach to the DPA or inform the affected data subjects about the data breach. Finally, the DPA initiated administrative proceedings, which eventually prompted the company to report the data breach and notify the two affected individuals about the incident."

The electronics company noted that the video surveillance system had been put in place to prevent any criminal activity and to strictly follow the movement of goods in the warehouses. However, the GDPR states that, to prevent theft, milder alternatives need to be considered first, before moving on to video surveillance. Video surveillance should only be used if there are any reasonable suspicions of theft for specific individuals. However, notebooksbilliger.de had no such suspicions, and utilized the video surveillance indefinitely for two years, without limiting its scope to specific individuals. Some video recordings were even retained for 60 days, which is well over the required time period in such cases. Lastly, many customers of notebooksbilliger.de were affected by the video surveillance, as some cameras covered the seating areas, as well."

However, the data subjects were not provided with an option to refuse to consent to this. If they disagreed with this action from the bank, they were supposed to send a letter of disagreement to each of the companies in the CaixaBank Group. Clearly, this is an absurd predicament, as the AEPD concluded that the bank did not respect its information obligations according to Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR. The information provided to the customers in the privacy policy was not accurate and consistent, it had vague and imprecise terminology, and failed to offer a clear picture of the nature of the data processing as well as what type of information would be processed. Information on the data subject’s rights and the contact information of the data controller were not offered consistently and accurately. Moreover, the DPA also argues that the customers’ consent was not taken effectively, and that the data controller had processed the customers’ data partly illegally, beyond the required scope. Moreover, various deficiencies in the bank’s systems allowed it to obtain consent from customers who had not expressly offered their consent. The data processing was done without a legal basis, thus breaching Art. 6 GDPR."

The DPA also notes that the company in question is a leading company in this domain in Croatia, and as such should hold relevant opinions, advice, and also propose solutions regarding the use of video surveillance systems, setting an example through its conduct."

A series of press reports appeared that raised suspicions with the institute’s data processing practices regarding the application review of politicians, and the Italian DPA formally investigated the INPS in August 2020. The DPA discovered several violations during the investigations. Apparently, the data controller had been collecting data related to tens of thousands of politicians from public sources, which it would crosscheck with data from the applicants. However, the data controller failed to ensure that should only be collected from those politicians who were eligible to receive these assistance funds. Because of this, the DPA concluded that the data controller had violated the principle of transparency, fairness, and lawfulness as set out by the GDPR. Moreover, the data controller had infringed upon the principle of data minimization after it initiated reimbursement checks on individuals who had their applications rejected and who would never receive those reimbursements. Finally, the Istituto Nazionale Previdenza Sociale had not done an impact assessment regarding the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, nor had it assessed the risks of the data processing operation as sensitive as one on applications for social benefits."

After hundreds of users had submitted complaints to the Italian DPA, preliminary investigations were carried out, and they discovered that the data controller had been illegally processing the personal data of millions of users for the purpose of telemarketing. More specifically, some of the call centers working for the company Fastweb S.p.A. disregarded any data protection regulations. They would use phone numbers to make calls that were not registered in any Italian register for communication operators. The company had also received contact data for promotions from external partners, which the call centers processed without the consent of the data subjects. Moreover, the users also reported about being contacted by individuals who claimed they were from Fastweb and who tried to obtain the contractors’ identity documents through WhatsApp, most likely for spamming, phishing, and other such fraudulent purposes. One last breach involved the procedures for the “call me back” service, which made it impossible to freely give their informed consent or deactivate the service automatically."

However, the image quality was sufficiently good to identify the type of car the data subjects had been driving, the clothes they’d been wearing, their hair color, and several other personal characteristics. Naturally, these details were more than enough for watchers of the livestream to identify family members, friends, coworkers, etc. The Norwegian DPA decided that the live stream breached Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) GDPR. This decision of the DPA underlines the fact that the live streams showed a significant number of employees, many of whom were monitored 24/7. The employees were going to and coming back from work, some bought groceries, alcohol, medication, or were in the public areas for various reasons. Such activities are not expected to be monitored or posted on the internet, everyone to see."

However, the second hospital’s system linked the first MRI (which was privately-arranged) to the patient’s records at this second hospital. It should be clear that the first MRI had been provided through the hospital network without a medical justification, due to the private nature. This turnaround was unfavorable for the data subject because, when the second MRI came, the doctor told him to contact his private physician or a social insurance regarding this injury, because the accident can’t be considered a work-related accident. The doctor also said that, since the first MRI had a non-occupational cause, the second MRI could not have an occupational cause either."

Back in December 2018, criminals had accessed the data of 4,109 people who had booked a hotel room through the Bookim.com booking site. The personal data included names, phone numbers, addresses, and booking details. The credit data of 283 people was also accessed, with 97 cases where the criminals managed to access the security code of the credit card. Moreover, the criminals also pretended to be employees of Booking.com in order to get the credit card details of other victims via phone or email. The company was notified of this data breach on January 13, 2019 but only notified the DPA on February 7, 2019. With 22 days of delay, the company was supposed to report the data breach to the DPA in 72 hours at most."

When trying to open up a new account with the data controller, the data subject was informed that opening an account was not possible because his data was blocked (as a result of the request for data erasure). The data subject was informed that if he wanted to open a new account, the data would have to be unblocked. In this sense, the letter came attached with a form. This form claimed that, upon signing it, the data subject would forfeit his previous request for data erasure, thus allowing the data controller to his data again. The Spanish DPA concluded that a temporary erasure of data did not legally correspond to the right to erasure.

This was a security breach that led to unauthorized access and the processing of multiple sets of personal data (28,085 data subjects) by hackers. The security breach happened because the IT provider failed to take the adequate security measures that would protect the personal information from being stolen, thus failing to consider the existing risks. The data controller, as a data processor, would have been forced to take adequate technical and security measures in a way that ensured the consistent anonymity of the personal data, including the regular testing, evaluation and the analysis of how effective anti-hacking responses would be, on the off-chance an attack did happen. During its security assessments, the data controller should have taken into consideration specific security risks related to the personal data of the 28,085 data subjects. Because of this failure to implement the adequate security measures, the Croatian DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider. We don’t know the amount of the fine at this moment. However, when implementing the fine, the DPA considered the nature of the IT provider’s business activity, whose role should have been support other companies through informed guidelines, offering solutions regarding the implementation of web applications, and how to design and introduce adequate technical and security measures."

Back in January 2021, the DPA as made aware that Medicals Nordic had been using WhatsApp messages to transmit confidential information and health data about citizens that were tested in the test centers of the company. The company had summoned to the WhatsApp group all employees working in a specific testing center. The members of these WhatsApp groups received all kinds of messages sent by other employees in the test center groups. All employees shared confidential information about tested citizens to the data controller’s central administration through those WhatsApp groups. However, this also meant that even employees who had no relation to the testing centers, still got access to the personal information of the citizens, which included health data, personal identity numbers, and inter alia."

            "summary": "The Finnish DPA has fined the magazine publisher with EUR 8,500. The DPA received four different complaints against the data controller because of unsolicited telephone advertising. The data controller had assumedly done direct marketing with an automated calling system, but without obtaining valid consent from the data subjects who received the marketing calls. More specifically, the data controller had obtained a form of consent for such direct marketing when any customer subscribed to the online magazine on its website. The subscriber was then required to accept the given terms of the subscription and contract, which also included a consent to direct marketing. But this is where the problem occurs. If the customer did not give his consent to the direct marketing, then he could also not subscribe to the magazine. The DPA claimed that the data controller requested and obtained consent in a way that isn’t compliant with the GDPR. Clearly, the data controller had not specifically requested consent for direct marketing, but rather got an apparent consent with a subscription and other contract terms. This form of consent does not constitute a valid form of consent for the purpose of direct marketing. Furthermore, the customers could not exercise their right to object to direct marketing, since the marketing was carried out by an automated system that could not answer specific queries of the customers. Lastly, the magazine publisher had commissioned an advertising call center to carry out this direct marketing, concluding a contract in this sense."

The French DPA conducted three separate investigations at BRICO PRIVÉ between 2018 and 2021, and found several deficiencies in the processing of personal data of customers and prospects. In one case, the data controller failed to comply with the data retention periods that it had established. Therefore, the data controller had unlawfully retained the personal data of more than 16,000 customers because they hadn’t placed an order in the last 5 years. The same happened to approximately 130,000 customers who had not logged into the company’s accounts in the last 5 years. Furthermore, the data controller violated its information obligations under Art. 13 GDPR. It also failed to fulfill its obligations to comply with the deletion requests received by the customers. The CNIL also discovered that the data controller failed to implement the adequate technical and organizational measures that would ensure information security. In one case, the data controller did not implement the use of a secure password when customers created an account on the company website, or when employees accessed the customer relationship management software. The fine is composed proportionately of EUR 300,000 for violations of Art. 5(1) e) GDPR, Art. 13 GDPR, Art. 17 GDPR and Art. 32 GDPR and EUR 200,000 for violations of Art. 82 Loi informatique et libertés and Art.

However, the room in which they had to change was a storage room that also contained large quantities of cleaning materials. This storage room was too small to allow employees (mostly minors) to change, so they changed in a general employee area (which was filmed by the video surveillance system). The data controller stated that the video surveillance system was installed for security purposes. The DPA concluded that the data controller had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, but that it would have to take into consideration the interests of the mostly underaged employees, as well. The data controller should have tried to implement less restrictive and invasive measures. Additionally, the DPA underlined that the information provided on video surveillance was insufficient in both the employee and customer service areas. In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA concluded that it was an aggravating factor that most of the employees were minors."

The data controller also did not check whether the addressees had given their consent for this transfer of data, for the purpose of advertising. The personal data received by Iren Mercato was from one company, who had received it from two other companies in the same way. The latter companies did indeed obtain consent from the potential customers for telemarketing purposes, but they had not given their consent for the customer data transfer to other companies.

For instance, the company’s systems processed the drivers&#8217; data to an extent that was thoroughly unnecessary and exceeded the purpose of the processing. In some cases, they stored the data significantly longer than was necessary. Additionally, the controller had failed to take the adequate technical and organizational measures that would ensure the secure data processing.

The company had accused him of improperly using the company’s resources for private purposes, having accessed Facebook for more than 40 minutes per day, and staying on YouTube for more than 3 hours. During an investigation, the DPA found out that the municipality had been actively monitoring employees’ internet browsing for over a decade, using a certain system of control and filters. They would retain data monthly, and create special reports for their network security purposes. The system would also collect information that was completely irrelevant regarding the employees’ professional activities and, in many cases, concerned the private lives of the individuals in question. The Italian DPA found out that the data controller had violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The data controller should have clearly taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of their Internet network. The Italian DPA pointed out that, despite the company needing to ensure employees don’t use the internet connection for their private use and only focus on their professional goals, this does not condone the total elimination of privacy of the data subjects at the workplace. Additionally, the data controller had failed to adequately inform employees about this collection of Internet history, thus violating its obligations under Article 13 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA investigation identified other violations in the processing of data regarding employees&#8217; requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which had been made using special forms.

This particular system processed personal and health data of ill people who lived in the municipality and used the respective health center. The system was also used for other services related to immunization programs and health checks and follow-ups for pregnant women. Approximately 2000 people were affected by this breach, and because of it, various errors appeared in the vaccine registration. So, this led to an increased risk of data subjects receiving the wrong vaccines. Not only this but their immunization data could have been misfiled in the national immunization registry because of the data breach. Moreover, the health programs for pregnant women also got an error related to the information about the week of pregnant and the motherțs drug use.

The fine consists of EUR 20,000 for a violation of Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR and EUR 6,000 for a violation of Art. 12 GDPR. The fine was issued because the controller installed a video surveillance system of 14 video cameras and monitored the business premises. The data controller claimed that the cameras had been installed for the purpose of security of the surrounding premises. However, the cameras also captured the employees&#8217; offices in a way that went beyond the original purpose of the surveillance system. For instance, one security camera captured a large part of the employees&#8217; recreation room. The DPA concluded that this was a violation of the principle of data minimization. Furthermore, the data controller hadn’t adequately informed the data subjects about the data processing via video surveillance, and thus violated its duty to inform. The fine was reduced to EUR 19,600 due to timely payment and admission of guilt."

They had to prevent threatening situations, document any dangerous incidents, and fine people who traveled without valid tickets on the public transportation in Stockholm. The ticket inspectors had to keep the camera on during their shift, and were able to capture all passengers who passed the inspector. Because a couple hundred thousand people use the public transportation daily, this was a major incident of potential data leakage because of the inspectors’ body cam footage that captured all these people. While the DPA understands how the body-worn surveillance system technology could prevent threatening situations, the pre-recording time should still be reduced to 15 seconds at best. Any longer than that and the recording becomes redundant and goes above the purpose of the body cam footage. The DPA also discovered that the audio recordings weren’t used to identify the individuals with no valid tickets. So, the DPA stated that capturing the audio recordings was a violation of the principles of transparency, data minimization, and legality. The DPA also firmly criticized the data controller for failing to provide adequate information about the camera surveillance, including the fact that both sounds and images were recorded."

The ICO conducted an investigation after it received a report of a data breach related to an internal email group. The ICO discovered that the group had insufficient security countermeasures, resulting in about 780 pages of confidential emails being made public online for three years. This led to an online leakage of personal information like names and email addresses, of about 550 people. The ICO states that Mermaids could have encrypted the access to its email group, and it could have used pseudonymization or encryption methods to offer additional protection for the personal data. Organizations like Mermaids, who are responsible for personal data of thousands of people, are obliged to ensure the adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of that personal data."

Afterwards, the region reported the matter to the authority as a personal data breach. The Region of Syddanmark had kept at the time a database for research and clinical purposes for a period of more than 1.5 years. However, the database inadequately secured against unauthorized access by unknown individuals. Through a manipulation of URLs, everyone could technically gain access to PDF documents stored in the database. This allowed all citizens who were registered in the database &#8211; and who also had login information to the database &#8211; to access the personal data of all the individuals registered in the database. The database also contained questionnaires with health information on more than 30,000 children receiving psychiatric care."

Regarding the data of prospects, the data controller failed to comply with the maximum retention period of three years as outlined in the reference framework and in the Group&#8217;s processing register.

The fine enforced by the Luxembourg DPA came as a result of a 2018 complaint by French privacy rights group, La Quadrature du Net. They argued that Amazon, among other big companies, manipulate customers through targeted content and advertising. They further argued that this was against the principles or privacy and information freedoms of all Europeans. Whether Amazon’s defense wins the case remains to be seen."

These violations included a clear lack of transparency regarding the algorithms used to manage drivers, both during the assignment of jobs and when they booked work shifts. Deliveroo had been using a centralized system to manage its drivers, but the system also processed the assignment of orders and the booking of work shifts. However, Garante noticed that the data controller failed to properly inform its drivers about how the system they had installed on their smartphones worked, and also failed to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the algorithmic systems they used to evaluate the drivers. Additionally, Garante also found that Deliveroo had underwent a detailed assessment of the drivers&#8217; work performance &#8211; through the continuous geolocation of their device, which was disproportionate to the assignment of the order (e.g., recording the drivers’ position every 12 seconds) &#8211; and through the retainment and storage of a certain amount of personal data the company collected during the execution of the orders, including any communication with customer service. In this sense, the company failed to mention or define the storage period of the personal data they had collected from the drivers. Instead, the data controller had only defined a flat storage period of six years. Moreover, Garante discovered that the data controller had failed to implement the necessary technical and organizational measures that would ensure adequate security of the data processing. Deliveroo Italy also failed to conduct a data protection impact assessment, despite this being necessary, considering the risk the drivers were exposed to."

The CNIL also received seven complaints from various data subjects affected by this file. For each of these individuals, the aforementioned file contained information regarding the organization the data subjects belonged to, the position they held, their cell phone number, business email address, business address, business phone number, and even Twitter accounts. Additionally, CNIL stated that each person had been assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their credibility, support, and influence for Monsanto on several issues. The DPA believes that the company had critically violated the regulations of the GDPR by failing to inform the data subjects that their personal data was processed and stored in this file. Furthermore, the CNIL claimed that the company had foregone the contractual guarantees which would have regulated the relationships between the company and other subcontractors. Still, creating contact files for lobbying purposes by stakeholders is not illegal. But the data subjects were still within their rights to be informed about their data being in this file, in order to exercise other rights, such as the right to object to the data storage. Moreover, the CNIL discovered that the data collection had been carried out by a data provider that Monsanto had contracted, though in violation of Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation because it failed to include in its contracts with the data processor the provisions stated in the GDPR, more specifically the provisions regarding data security."

The DPA concluded that the data controller violated its duty as a data controller to provide consent and clarification in an understandable and easily accessible form in clear and simple language.

The data controller had previously implemented a mobile application, allowing teleworkers to clock in and out. However, to use this application on a mobile device, the workers had to provide location data. The data collection took place automatically when the workers clocked in, and it was an in-built feature of the app. Without this feature, the workers couldn’t clock in. Based on the information provided by the data controller, this location data was not used nor exploited in any specific way, but rather it was only processed when the workers clocked in, for technical reasons. However, the simple fact that the app doesn’t allow workers to clock in without collecting their location data doesn’t make it a necessity to collect that data. The company could have devised the app differently. At that point, the Finnish DPA concluded that the company had violated data collection principles as well as the principle of data minimization, since it wasn’t necessary to collect location data."

Moreover, the risk of retaliation and discrimination in the work environment is unusually high. Moving on, the data controller is always obliged to comply with the principle of data protection, as well as ensure the security and integrity of the data. In this context, the Italian DPA (also known as Garante) fined Aeroporto Guglielmo Marconi di Bologna S.p.a. with EUR 4,000 and its software supplier, aiComply S.r.l. with EUR 20,000. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the application used for managing and collecting criminal reports had been accessed without a security protocol. Moreover, the application failed to provide encryption for the reporting party’s identification data, the attached documents, and any information about the reports. The DPA concluded this was a violation of the obligation to take adequate organizational and technical measures that would ensure a proper level of security relevant to the risk to the data subjects. Moreover, the DPA found out that the data controller should have carried out an impact assessment, considering how sensitive the processed data was, and the magnitude of the vulnerabilities of the data subjects."

The stick was used to store the data of about 400 persons under probation supervision. The lost and unencrypted data carrier has been found yet, so this means that unauthorized persons could still be able to access the personal data it contained. The president had wrongfully assumed that the duty to secure the data wasn’t his but the respective probation officers’ who were using this data stick. However, the DPA found that the president himself should have secured the USB sticks."

These display services would stop existing at the moment the data subject used her right to stop working with the data controller. Additionally, the DPA found out that the data controller failed to facilitate the data subject’s access to her rights as per Art. 12 GDPR. Finally, while the data controller provided a public email address on its website through which the data subject could maintain communication, the controller was understaffed and there was no one to process this communication."

            "summary": "The Greek DPA fined the Rhodes Municipal Transport Company with a fine of EUR 8,000. One of the former employees of the transport company filed a complaint against it with the DPA. At that time, the employee was engaged in a legal dispute with the transport company after the employer had reported him for alleged embezzlement. In this context, the employee had requested from the employer a copy of the video recordings taken by the bus’s video surveillance system during the data that the alleged embezzlement occurred. This video recording was necessary for this defense. However, the data controller failed to respond to this request. The DPA concluded that this was a clear violation of the data subject’s right to information, as per Art. 12 (3) GDPR and Art. 15 GDPR. Moreover, the data controller provided the former employee with a certificate of his former employment. Among others, the certificate contained the duration and type of the employment, as well as a notice of dismissal on charges of criminal offenses. This was a violation of the principle of proportionality as per Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR, according to the GDPR. The issued fine consists of EUR 3,000 for violating Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR and EUR 5,000 for violating Art. 12 (3) and Art. 15 GDPR."

            "summary": "The Norwegian DPA has fined Ferde AS, which is a Norwegian toll company, with EUR 496,000. After receiving a report from NRK, state-owned broadcasting company, the Norwegian DPA started investigating Ferde AS, discovering that the company had been transferring information on passages in various toll rings to a data processor in China. In this context, the DPA started a large-scale investigation into the company, with the purpose of finding out whether the company had implemented measures and routines that could ensure the information security of this information transfer to China. It should be noted that Ferde AS was also responsible for registering passages at toll booths through a chip in the car. If a car had no chip or if the chip wasn’t properly registered, a photo of the car’s license plate would be taken. These images would then be sent to an automatic optical character recognition system that would digitally read the license plate. If the image wasn’t clear enough, it would go through manual processing. Ferde AS had contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS) to do this job. During the investigation, the DPA found out that the subcontractor also had employees in China. Moreover, Ferde AS had violated many obligations under the GDPR for 1-2 years. In on instance, Ferde failed to conduct a risk management assessment before the processing of personal data and the processing of manual images. This risk assessment was necessary to assess any underlying risks associated with the data transfer, and to also determine whether further security measures should be taken. Additionally, the DPA discovered that Ferde did not enter an official processor contract with UBS. Therefore, the transfer of personal data to China occurred without a legal basis. When determining the value of the fine, the DPA also considered the large amount of the affected personal data as an aggravating factor. However, the implicated data subjects received no material or immaterial damage, which had a mitigating effect on this whole affair."

After the insurance company contacted the data controller, the latter transmitted the medical records of the data subject to the insurance company. But by doing so, the data controller offered the insurer a report of another MRI scan of the knew that the data subject had received for an event outside of work. While assessing the need for a sick leave, the insurer considered the MRI report in the medical records outside working hours, attributing the data subject’s incapacity to work to this event. So, they granted no sic leave to the data subject. The DPA considered that the data controller unlawfully disclosed the MRI report to the insurer, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality. The original fine of EUR 30,000 was briefly reduced to EUR 18,000 because of voluntary payment and admission of guilt."
