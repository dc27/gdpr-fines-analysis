This fraudulent website would harvest the customer details of all clients taken there. The personal data of more than 500,000 customers was harvested during the incident. During the ICO’s investigation, it was found that British Airways was mainly to blame for much of the compromised information, due to inadequate security measures, such as log-in, payment card, and travel booking details.

However, the company was very cooperative with the data protection authority, so the fine was reduced from EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. The culpability of the company was reasonably low to justify this decrease in the fine’s value, due to the fact that the company’s procedure of identifying customers through the hotline by asking only the name and date of birth wasn’t objected by any customer, so the company wasn’t aware of the problem this procedure posed.

The DPA concluded this as a failure of the municipality to implement the necessary technical and organizational measures that would ensure adequate data protection."

Back in 2018, the DPA was contacted by a data subject who complained that his former employer, the aforementioned Nordbornholms Byggeforretning ApS, had unlawfully disclosed personal information about him to the company&#8217;s customers. The data controller had sent emails to two company customers, in which it informed them that the former employee had committed crimes during his time working of the company, to which he had freely admitted. The data controller then went on to describe the crimes in detail. According to the Dannish DPA, the data controller in this case, had a legitimate interest in not withholding information about the former employee&#8217;s crimes to its customers. It was within its rights to inform its customers that, due to these crimes, the former employee would not continue working for the company and could not see to the customers’ needs. However, there was no need to go into details about the nature of the crime, and the DPA concluded this was an unlawful act."

The members of these WhatsApp groups received all kinds of messages sent by other employees in the test center groups. All employees shared confidential information about tested citizens to the data controller’s central administration through those WhatsApp groups. However, this also meant that even employees who had no relation to the testing centers, still got access to the personal information of the citizens, which included health data, personal identity numbers, and inter alia."

The DPA received four different complaints against the data controller because of unsolicited telephone advertising. The data controller had assumedly done direct marketing with an automated calling system, but without obtaining valid consent from the data subjects who received the marketing calls. More specifically, the data controller had obtained a form of consent for such direct marketing when any customer subscribed to the online magazine on its website. The subscriber was then required to accept the given terms of the subscription and contract, which also included a consent to direct marketing. But this is where the problem occurs. If the customer did not give his consent to the direct marketing, then he could also not subscribe to the magazine. The DPA claimed that the data controller requested and obtained consent in a way that isn’t compliant with the GDPR. Clearly, the data controller had not specifically requested consent for direct marketing, but rather got an apparent consent with a subscription and other contract terms. This form of consent does not constitute a valid form of consent for the purpose of direct marketing. Furthermore, the customers could not exercise their right to object to direct marketing, since the marketing was carried out by an automated system that could not answer specific queries of the customers. Lastly, the magazine publisher had commissioned an advertising call center to carry out this direct marketing, concluding a contract in this sense."

In one case, the data controller failed to comply with the data retention periods that it had established. Therefore, the data controller had unlawfully retained the personal data of more than 16,000 customers because they hadn’t placed an order in the last 5 years. The same happened to approximately 130,000 customers who had not logged into the company’s accounts in the last 5 years.

The CNIL also discovered that the data controller failed to implement the adequate technical and organizational measures that would ensure information security. In one case, the data controller did not implement the use of a secure password when customers created an account on the company website, or when employees accessed the customer relationship management software.

During employee shifts, the employees wore clothing provided by the data controller. However, the room in which they had to change was a storage room that also contained large quantities of cleaning materials. This storage room was too small to allow employees (mostly minors) to change, so they changed in a general employee area (which was filmed by the video surveillance system). The data controller stated that the video surveillance system was installed for security purposes. The DPA concluded that the data controller had a legitimate interest in the video surveillance, but that it would have to take into consideration the interests of the mostly underaged employees, as well. The data controller should have tried to implement less restrictive and invasive measures. Additionally, the DPA underlined that the information provided on video surveillance was insufficient in both the employee and customer service areas.

During its investigation against the data controller, the DPA discovered that the personal data the controller had processed for its telemarketing activities was acquire from external sources and not gathered personally. The data controller also did not check whether the addressees had given their consent for this transfer of data, for the purpose of advertising. The personal data received by Iren Mercato was from one company, who had received it from two other companies in the same way.

For instance, the company’s systems processed the drivers&#8217; data to an extent that was thoroughly unnecessary and exceeded the purpose of the processing.

During an investigation, the DPA found out that the municipality had been actively monitoring employees’ internet browsing for over a decade, using a certain system of control and filters. They would retain data monthly, and create special reports for their network security purposes. The system would also collect information that was completely irrelevant regarding the employees’ professional activities and, in many cases, concerned the private lives of the individuals in question. The Italian DPA found out that the data controller had violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The data controller should have clearly taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of their Internet network. The Italian DPA pointed out that, despite the company needing to ensure employees don’t use the internet connection for their private use and only focus on their professional goals, this does not condone the total elimination of privacy of the data subjects at the workplace. Additionally, the data controller had failed to adequately inform employees about this collection of Internet history, thus violating its obligations under Article 13 of the GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA investigation identified other violations in the processing of data regarding employees&#8217; requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which had been made using special forms.

Back in May 2019, several media outlets revealed that MONSANTO possessed a file that contained the personal data of more than 200 political figures or members of civil society (e.g., scientists, farmers, journalists, or environmental activists) who would most likely be influential in the public debate regarding the renewal and authorization of glyphosate across Europe. The CNIL also received seven complaints from various data subjects affected by this file. For each of these individuals, the aforementioned file contained information regarding the organization the data subjects belonged to, the position they held, their cell phone number, business email address, business address, business phone number, and even Twitter accounts. Additionally, CNIL stated that each person had been assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their credibility, support, and influence for Monsanto on several issues. The DPA believes that the company had critically violated the regulations of the GDPR by failing to inform the data subjects that their personal data was processed and stored in this file. Furthermore, the CNIL claimed that the company had foregone the contractual guarantees which would have regulated the relationships between the company and other subcontractors. Still, creating contact files for lobbying purposes by stakeholders is not illegal. But the data subjects were still within their rights to be informed about their data being in this file, in order to exercise other rights, such as the right to object to the data storage. Moreover, the CNIL discovered that the data collection had been carried out by a data provider that Monsanto had contracted, though in violation of Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation because it failed to include in its contracts with the data processor the provisions stated in the GDPR, more specifically the provisions regarding data security."

Also, the privacy notice was complicated, with the wording containing grammatical errors and making use of uncommon and needlessly complex terminology. Finally, the privacy notice also required a tax identification number in order to issue a simplified invoice, i.e., an invoice that did not exceed the amount of EUR 3,000. The AEPD stated that this was a violation of the principle of legality. The fine is composed as follows: EUR 3,000 for a breach of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR; EUR 1,000 for a breach of Art. 21 (4) GDPR; and EUR 2,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 GDPR."

The specific computer hard drive was unencrypted and the program, which contained sensitive and private personal data, wasn’t equipped with any security measures. While investigating the case, the DPA discovered that the Favrskov Municipality had failed to ensure the encryption of the laptops’ hard drives for a long time before August 12, 2020, which resulted in an inadequate level of security.

The data controller made a comparison between contracts concluded by existing customers and potential customers who had previously submitted inquiries for special contracts. The data controller would reject the application for special contract if it was revealed that the application had previously signed a contract with the data controller then switched to another supplier.

After receiving a report from NRK, state-owned broadcasting company, the Norwegian DPA started investigating Ferde AS, discovering that the company had been transferring information on passages in various toll rings to a data processor in China. In this context, the DPA started a large-scale investigation into the company, with the purpose of finding out whether the company had implemented measures and routines that could ensure the information security of this information transfer to China. It should be noted that Ferde AS was also responsible for registering passages at toll booths through a chip in the car. If a car had no chip or if the chip wasn’t properly registered, a photo of the car’s license plate would be taken. These images would then be sent to an automatic optical character recognition system that would digitally read the license plate. If the image wasn’t clear enough, it would go through manual processing. Ferde AS had contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS) to do this job. During the investigation, the DPA found out that the subcontractor also had employees in China. Moreover, Ferde AS had violated many obligations under the GDPR for 1-2 years. In on instance, Ferde failed to conduct a risk management assessment before the processing of personal data and the processing of manual images. This risk assessment was necessary to assess any underlying risks associated with the data transfer, and to also determine whether further security measures should be taken. Additionally, the DPA discovered that Ferde did not enter an official processor contract with UBS. Therefore, the transfer of personal data to China occurred without a legal basis. When determining the value of the fine, the DPA also considered the large amount of the affected personal data as an aggravating factor. However, the implicated data subjects received no material or immaterial damage, which had a mitigating effect on this whole affair."

Apparently, the draft addresses the fact that Facebook had included specific details on data processing in its terms of service, following the provisions of Art. 6 (1) b) rather than Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR. Some critics call this a loophole that Facebook intelligently uses to bypass the strict GDPR requirements of consent, those of Art. 6 (1) a). On the other hand, the DPC clearly states that the GDPR doesn’t establish any hierarchy of specific legal bases that a company can use to process personal data. However, the DPC further noted that Facebook did not provide any clear information regarding the legal basis it used for the data processing, further emphasizing that Facebook provides discontinuous information. The company also sends users to various texts and documents of the terms of services and data policy.

This video surveillance system recorded, among others, the connecting corridor  between the accommodation and the communal showers. This footage was recorded and displayed in real time on the staff’s monitors, thus creating a risk that the footage could be seen by suppliers or the visitors. During the DPA’s investigation, the administration of the institution argued that they had installed the video surveillance system to combat theft and provide adequate safety to the residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic. However, the DPA stated that the institute had violated the principles of transparency, lawfulness, and data minimization. Even though the institution claimed that the quality of the footage showing the passage of the residents to the shower room was not clear enough and also of a short duration, the DPA states it was still unlawful. The DPA also claims that the institute could have ensured the safety of its residents in other, less invasive ways that would not restrict the freedoms of the data subjects, referring to a temporary switch-off of the cameras when filming the corridor to the shower rooms, or ensuring the security of these locations through other measures aside from video surveillance. Moreover, the DPA states that the institute failed in properly informing its residents about the video surveillance. They only provided information about the surveillance system to their residents after the DPA investigation had formally begun. Ironically, the information they offered wasn’t suitable for blind or visually impaired people.

During the emergency situation of the Covid-19 pandemic where students couldn’t take live exams and in person, the university acquired a remote monitoring software called Respondus, from the American company called Respondus Inc. This software would monitor the students’ behavior via video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. Additionally, the exam was also audio-visually recorded, and the students had their photographs taken at the beginning of the exam. When the exam finished, the system would process the video and insert warning signals attached to each video, regarding potential indications of incorrect behavior (foul play). Among others, the system assigned “review priorities” to various videos so the examiner could further analyze whether there was any foul play in the video. During an investigation, the DPA discovered that the students hadn’t been informed about the processing of their personal data via Respondus. For instance, the students hadn’t been informed that they would be audio-visually recorded, and that these images would then be processed. Moreover, the students weren’t provided with any information regarding the retention period of this data. They also weren’t given enough information about whether or not their data would be transferred to the United States. Instead, they were only told that their data would be processed both inside and outside the European Union. Moreover, the DPA also found that even the information provided to the students had been chaotic and disorganized, placed in multiple documents in a fragmented form. This is a clear violation of the principles of fairness, transparency, and lawfulness, according to the DPA. The DPA also found that the university had processed this personal data without a proper legal basis. They needed to obtain the consent of the students regarding this personal data, before they participated in the exams. Alternatively, the university proposed in-person exams but the pandemic meant that this option presented certain health risks. The students also thought that refusing to take the online exams would clearly impact their grades. So, the DPA concluded that the students had not voluntarily given their consent. Moreover, the DPA also discovered that the university had retained the data for 12 months, despite this not being necessary for the purpose of making sure that the exams were valid. Finally, the DPA also discovered several violations regarding the transfer of data to Respondus. Namely, the processing agreement between Respondus and the university relied on the data protection agreement between the USA and the EU, the Privacy Shield agreement, which had previously been invalidated by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Thus, the DPA concluded that the university unlawfully transferred the personal data of the students to a third country, despite this not being compliant with the conditions stipulated in Chapter V of the GDPR."

The DPA received numerous complaints from people claiming that they’d received unsolicited telemarketing calls and SMS messages from Sky Italia directly and via various call centers of other companies. So, the DPA started investigating the phenomenon. They found out that Sky Italia had made the calls without properly informing the users how they got their hands on the data subject’s personal data. If Sky Italia had done this, the data subjects could have opposed to the data processing by contacting the company who had their data and objecting to the data processing. If the data subjects gave their consent, only then would Sky Italia be allowed to send them commercial offers. Instead, the company used the personal data obtained from various companies for these promotional purposes. However, despite the fact that the data subjects had given their consent to the disclosure of their data to said third party companies, Sky Italia had no right to acquire these lists of personal information and use them for its own promotional purposes. Additionally, Sky Italia also failed to check the list of individuals who had objected to the data processing regarding the advertising messages. Instead, the company proceeded with the marketing calls without taking this into account. Several data subjects who had objected to the data processing ended up receiving advertising calls. Moreover, the DPA discovered that Sky Italia did not appoint its data suppliers as data processors. When calculating the fine, the DPA considered the fact that Sky Italia’s violations implicated a “systemic” conduct that was integral to the company’s other operations, as well as the fact that the company should have made better decisions considering its experience and competence. Given its long-term presence in the market and constant contact with the authorities, Sky Italia should have known better."

However, to vote for the best drawing, the company posted the children’s drawings on the online platform, but they also posted the personal data in the participation forms by accident. During the investigation, the Romanian DPA concluded that this security incident had resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of personal data of IKEA family members (first name, surname, and age of minors, and the first name, surname, country, city, email address, IKEA family membership number, and the signature of the parents) on the company’s online platform that was accessible only to IKEA family members in Romania.

The CNIL then investigated several RATP bus centers. This way, the CNIL confirmed that this was true in three of the RATP bus centers. The French DPA further confirmed that files referring to performance evaluations and prospects should only even contain data that was necessary for evaluating employees during work hours. More specifically, it would have been sufficient that these files indicated the total number of days of absence without detailing and distinguishing between days of absence and days where the workers exercised their right to strike. The CNIL discovered that the data related to the number of days the staff members were on strike haven’t been used for the right purpose, so the RATP had violated the principle of data minimization as per Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR. Furthermore, the DPA also found that the RATP has excessively retained some of the employees’ data. More specifically, the RAPT had retained files regarding the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission had taken place. The data retention term was 18 months after the commissions were held, so the RATP also violated this principle. The CNIL discovered that the RATP hadn’t differentiated between staff authorization levels properly either, allowing more staff members than necessary to retain certain data. In conclusion, the CNIL considered that the RATP failed to implement the appropriate organizational and technical measures to ensure a proper level of protection appropriate for the risk at hand."

The attacked had stolen data and left a ransom note on the database servers. Because of insufficient data logging, the DPA couldn’t identify the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses that the attacker used.

The patient database server was left open to the Internet without firewall protection between November 26th, 2017, and March 13th, 2019.

The DPA found out that that the information provided about the data processing wasn’t sufficient to warrant it. Moreover, YAY ehf and the ministry didn’t implement proper organizational and technical measures that would ensure the appropriate security of the personal data processing. Because of a configuration error of the YAY company, the amount of processed data was more than needed, so the DPA also determined this to be a violation of the principle of data minimization."

The personal data included names, phone numbers, addresses, personal identification numbers, email addresses, type of payment cards, the last four digits of the data subject’s card numbers, and diver’s license numbers. During the investigation, the DPA discovered that the published personal data came from an unsecured backup copy of a database of the company. The DPA further discovered that this data breach had taken place because of the company’s failure to comply with its obligation to implement the required organizational and technical measures that would ensure adequate security appropriate to the risk of the data subjects. For instance, the company didn’t appoint a person competent enough to oversee the security and risk management. It also didn’t ensure that accesses to database files were logged and evaluated. Moreover, the company hadn’t encrypted the stored databases. A person with enough technical knowledge could gain full access to the data contained in the file after downloading it.

Grindr is a location-based social networking app that was designed for bi, gay, trans, and queer people. Back in 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority had filed a complaint against Grindr to the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the platform had shared information about its users’ GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender to other third parties for marketing, without obtaining the consent of the data subjects. As per GDPR, that personal data should have only been shared with consent from the data subjects. However, the DPA discovered during its investigation that the consent collected by Grindr was invalid. Users had to accept a privacy policy when using the app but the policy didn’t explicitly ask them whether they consented to their data being shared to third parties for marketing purposes. Moreover, information about the disclosure of personal data wasn’t immediately clear or accessible to users. The DPA shows that the type of data disclosed could identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. The users would sometimes use this app anonymously without inputting their full name or uploading a photo of them. As for the sexual orientation of the users, it was made part of a special category of personal data that is subject to a special, high level of protection. The DPA concludes that this infringement was particularly serious and it justifies a high fine as a deterrent. GDPR considers that this type of fine should act as a strong deterrent for business models based on behavior-based marketing, which are widespread in the digital economy today."

The CNIL received several complaints about the manner in which google.fr and youtube.com approached the manner in which users could refuse cookies on these websites. The CNIL did an online review of these websites and discovered that, despite there being a button to accept the cookies instantly, there was no such button to reject them. To reject the cookies, you had to go through several options, as opposed to one option for accepting the cookies. The CNIL concluded that, in most cases, users accepted the cookies out of convenience rather than because they agreed to it. It also concluded that the way these cookie deposits were designed is an interference with the freedom of consent of internet users, violating Art. 82 of the French Law on Informatics and Freedoms. When determining the fine, the CNIL took into consideration the large number of people who were affected in such an aggravating manner. Additionally, the CNIL also considered the significant profits that the companies could make from advertisements generated indirectly from the data collected through these cookies.

The DPA had previously received many complaints against IAB Europe ever since 2019. Regarding this complaint, the DPA questioned the compliance of IAB Europe with the “Transparency &#038; Consent Framework (TCF). The TCF had been developed by IAB to promote compliance with the GDPR through organizations that used the OpenRTB protocol. This protocol is used for “real-time bidding” like the automated online auctions of user profiles regarding the purchase and sale of advertising space on the web. Users would visit websites that contain ad space that technology companies can bid for in real time through automated auction systems. This was done to display personalized advertising to users. Upon visiting a website for the first time, an interface would appear asking users for consent to the collection, sharing, and other types of processing of their personal information. During this process, the TCF employs a specific consent management tool that allows users to reject certain types of data processing. This TCF remembers the users’ preferences via the consent management tool by generating a TC string and sending it to everyone that participates in the OpenRTB system. This TC string allows user profiles to be compiled and sent to advertisers. The advertisers will see the types of data processing that the users have agreed to. The DPA noticed that the IAB had violated several of the GDPR regulations during the investigation. It discovered that these TC strings already contained personal data, which required a legal basis for its processing, which IAB did not have. IAB couldn’t prove that it had any legal basis to process these TC strings, though. For instance, when users were informed about the data processing, the information provided to them was far too generic and vague to properly understand the purpose of the data processing. Moreover, IAB did not maintain any register of its data processing activities and had also failed to appoint a data protection officer. It also did not conduct any data protection impact assessment."

The workshop claimed that its legal basis for using the CCTV system was the consent given by the employees.

Two data subjects had filed complaints to the DPA that Google had previously disclosed their personal data to several third parties without their consent. During the lengthy investigation, the DPA discovered that Google had sent the personal data of the data subjects to the Lumen Project. Lumen is a project that’s managed and run by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &#038; Society of the Harvard University. This project began in 2002 for the official purpose of collecting requests related to the removal of content from websites both within and outside of the US. Researchers and other interested parties may then access this data for studies. However, users of the YouTube, Google Drive and other Google-operated platforms could request that the content related to themselves be deleted from these platforms. To this end, Google has provided several complaint and contact forms. However, the data of the people who filed out these forms was automatically transferred to the Lumen Project. The users were not given the chance to object to this data transmission because the process was automatic, and it was a hardwired condition for completing the forms. Consequently, the DPA concluded that Google had no valid legal basis to process the data subjects’ data because of this lack of consent regarding the transfer of data to Lumen. In this context, the DPA also discovered that Google did not sufficiently enable the data subjects to exercise their rights of erasure of their data. When analyzing the fine, the DPA took into consideration several aggravating factors: the data was disclosed and transferred to a third-party country without giving the data subjects a chance to object to the transfer. Moreover, this deprived the data subjects of control over their personal data and its transfer. Additionally, the DPA discovered that this transfer had taken place over a long period of time. Another aggravating factor was that a very large number of individuals were affected by this data transfer, and in some cases, sensitive data had been processed."

The Austrian Organization “None of Your Business” (NOYB) had complained to the DPA on behalf of a data subject. WhatsApp had recently updated its terms of service shortly after the GDPR came into force. In the ToS, WhatsApp informed its users to click “Agree and Continue” to show that they agree with the new terms of service. This was also required for further access to the messaging service. WhatsApp assumed that this consent to the updated Terms of Service constituted a contract between the user and WhatsApp Ireland because the data processing would have been necessary for the provision and the improvements of the messaging service. The data processing was, therefore, lawful according to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant claimed that WhatsApp was trying to process the users’ data by relying on the fact that this consent was lawful. WhatsApp Ireland actually forced users to consent to the processing of their personal data by making access to its services conditional on the users’ consent to the updated Terms of Service. After the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to the other European supervisory authorities implicated. The DPC discovered that WhatsApp had not relied on user content as a legal basis, which further means that “coerced consent” did not apply in this case. Though, this also did not rule out the possibility that WhatsApp had relied on a contractual basis. As a response, the DPC received objections from 6 supervisory authorities. On the other hand, the DPC discovered that Meta had breached its transparency obligations as per the GDPR. Apparently, Meta had not clearly explained to its users for what purpose and on what legal basis would their personal data be processed. Since they couldn’t reach an agreement on these disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure as per Art. 65 GDPR. When making its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by WhatsApp. Apparently, the EPDB had a different perception than the DPC regarding WhatsApp’s entitlement to rely on the contractual legal basis to process the users’ personal data. The EPDB concluded that WhatsApp had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. So, the DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed a fine of EUR 5.5 million, as well as required WhatsApp to bring its data processing into compliance within 6 months."
